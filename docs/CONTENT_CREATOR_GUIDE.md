## üéØ **Quick Start**

### **Footnotes (Enhanced - Same Syntax)**
```markdown
Your text with a citation[^1] and analysis[^2].
```
HTML footnote cards (place at bottom):
```html
<div data-ref="1">Citation content here</div>
<div data-ref="2">Analysis explanation</div>
```

### **Extensions (New Feature)**
```markdown
Analysis text.[+][Extended commentary that provides deeper insight.]
```
*Result: Creates an orange `+` button that expands inline*

---

## üìù **Enhanced Footnotes**

### **How They Work**
Footnotes work exactly as before, but with significant improvements:
- **Better tooltips** that never extend beyond screen edges
- **Mobile-responsive** design optimized for all devices  
- **Accessibility features** including keyboard navigation
- **Improved positioning** that adapts to content and viewport

### **Writing Footnotes**
Continue using the same syntax you already know:

```markdown
The research shows significant results[^1] across multiple studies[^2].

Recent developments[^3] have challenged previous assumptions.
```

### **Footnote HTML Cards**
Format your footnote cards exactly as before:

```html
<div data-ref="1">
  Smith, J. "Research Methodology in Digital Studies" 
  (Academic Press, 2024), pp. 45-67.
</div>

<div data-ref="2">
  Three major studies published between 2022-2024 showed 
  consistent patterns. See the meta-analysis by Johnson et al.
</div>

<div data-ref="3">
  The 2024 symposium at MIT revealed new approaches that 
  <strong>contradict</strong> the established framework.
</div>
```

### **Enhanced Features You Get**
- **Smart Tooltips**: Hover over footnote numbers for instant preview
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab to footnotes, Enter/Space to activate
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly on all device sizes
- **Theme Integration**: Footnotes adapt to your theme colors
- **Performance**: Faster loading and smoother interactions

## üé® **Paragraph Extensions (New)**

### **What Are Extensions?**
Extensions let you add expandable commentary directly in paragraphs using simple `[+][content]` syntax. They create interactive orange `+` buttons that expand inline.

### **Perfect For:**
- **Detailed Explanations** - Technical details without cluttering main text
- **Extended Analysis** - Deeper insight for interested readers
- **Optional Context** - Background information that enhances understanding
- **Academic Commentary** - Scholarly elaboration without interrupting flow

### **Basic Extension Syntax**
```markdown
Main paragraph text.[+][Extended commentary goes here.]
```

**Result:** Creates an orange `+` button that expands to show the extended content.

### **Advanced Extension Features**

#### **Multiple Extensions Per Paragraph**
```markdown
First point.[+][Detail about first point.] Second point.[+][Detail about second.] 
```

#### **Markdown Support in Extensions**
```markdown
Analysis.[+][Extended commentary with **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting.]
```

#### **Complex Content**
```markdown
Research findings.[+][This extension contains:

**Key Findings:**
- Point one with *emphasis*
- Point two with `technical terms`
- Point three with [nested brackets]

The methodology section provides additional context for these results.]
```

### **Extension Best Practices**

#### **Content Guidelines**
- ‚úÖ **Keep focused** - Extensions should relate directly to the paragraph
- ‚úÖ **Provide value** - Include information that deepens understanding  
- ‚úÖ **Stay concise** - Aim for 50-200 words per extension
- ‚úÖ **Use formatting** - Basic markdown makes content more readable
- ‚ùå **Avoid essential info** - Don't put critical information only in extensions

#### **Writing Style**
- **Main text**: Should be complete and understandable without extensions
- **Extensions**: Should enhance, not replace, the main argument
- **Tone**: Match your main text tone - extensions aren't footnotes

#### **Technical Considerations**
- Extensions expand **inline** - they don't navigate away from current position
- Each extension is **independent** - readers can expand only what interests them
- **Mobile-friendly** - Extensions work well on all device sizes
- **Accessible** - Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üîÄ **Using Footnotes + Extensions Together**

### **When to Use Which**

| **Use Footnotes For:** | **Use Extensions For:** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Citations and references | Detailed explanations |
| External sources | Extended analysis |
| Tangential information | Optional technical details |
| Traditional academic notes | Inline commentary |
| Information that redirects attention | Information that deepens current focus |

### **Example of Mixed Usage**
```markdown
The study methodology[^1] employed advanced statistical techniques.[+][The specific techniques included multiple regression analysis, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Each technique was chosen for its ability to handle the complex relationships in the dataset.] Results showed significant correlations[^2] across all measured variables.
```

**Results:**
- `[^1]` creates a footnote tooltip and collection entry
- `[+][...]` creates an orange button that expands inline  
- `[^2]` creates another footnote
- Readers can interact with each type independently

---

## üì± **Mobile & Accessibility**

### **Mobile Optimization**
Both systems are fully mobile-responsive:
- **Footnotes**: Tooltips adapt to mobile viewports, with fallback to footnote collection
- **Extensions**: Expand inline with mobile-optimized styling and spacing
- **Touch-friendly**: All interactive elements sized appropriately for touch

### **Accessibility Features**
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through footnotes and extensions, Enter/Space to activate
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels announce content type and state
- **Visual Design**: High contrast support and customizable themes
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preference for reduced animations

---

## üîß **Workflow Integration**

### **In the Ghost Editor**
1. **Write normally** - Use the Ghost editor exactly as you always have
2. **Add footnotes** - Type `[^1]`, `[^2]`, etc. where you want citations
3. **Add extensions** - Type `[+][extended content]` where you want expandable detail
4. **Create footnote cards** - Add HTML cards at the bottom of your post
5. **Preview and publish** - The system automatically processes everything

### **Content Planning**
When planning content that uses both systems:

1. **Write the main text first** - Ensure it's complete and readable standalone
2. **Add footnotes** - Include necessary citations and references  
3. **Identify extension opportunities** - Places where extra detail would help
4. **Draft extensions** - Keep them focused and valuable
5. **Review mobile experience** - Test how content works on smaller screens

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Footnotes Not Working**
- ‚úÖ Check HTML format: Must be `<div data-ref="1">content</div>`
- ‚úÖ Verify numbers match: `[^1]` must match `data-ref="1"`
- ‚úÖ Ensure footnote cards are at bottom of post

#### **Extensions Not Appearing**
- ‚úÖ Check syntax: Must be exactly `[+][content]`
- ‚úÖ Verify extensions are enabled (admin setting)
- ‚úÖ Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

#### **Mobile Display Issues**
- ‚úÖ Test in actual mobile browsers, not just desktop resize
- ‚úÖ Check that content isn't too long for mobile screens
- ‚úÖ Verify touch interactions work properly

#### **Accessibility Problems**
- ‚úÖ Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
- ‚úÖ Verify screen reader announcements
- ‚úÖ Check color contrast in your theme

### **Getting Help**
If you encounter issues:
1. **Check browser console** - Press F12 and look for error messages
2. **Try debug commands** - Type `debugContentConfig()` in console  
3. **Test in different browsers** - Verify issue isn't browser-specific
4. **Contact admin** - System configuration might need adjustment

- **Balance content types** - Mix regular text, footnotes, and extensions thoughtfully

### **SEO Considerations**
- All content (main text, footnotes, extensions) is fully searchable
- Extensions expand into regular HTML, so search engines index everything
- Use semantic markup in footnote cards for better search results
