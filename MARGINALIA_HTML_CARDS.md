## Complete HTML Cards (In Order of Appearance):

### 1. Edward Said Quote (Early, Academic Citation)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="15" data-size="large">
<em>"Every time I write 'Israel' or 'Palestine,' I perform a cut in the world. These names are not descriptions but acts of political force."</em><br>—Edward Said
</div>
```

### 2. Olive Tree Photo (Visual, Historical)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="20">
[A photograph of an uprooted olive tree, no caption]
</div>
```

### 3. Self-Critique of "You" (Reflexive Doubt)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="25">
Already this "you" assumes too much. Who is this subject who begins with particular critique? The comfortable critic? The situated observer? The claim to begin anywhere already claims too much.
</div>
```

### 4. Spinoza Irony (Academic Critique)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="30">
/* Every appeal to Spinoza in discussions of Israel-Palestine carries its own bitter irony. The philosopher of radical democracy becomes the name of a street in a settlement. His ethics of joy becomes a justification for occupation. How texts travel, how they betray themselves in their applications... */
</div>
```

### 5. Graffiti Photo (Political, Visual)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="35">
[A photograph of the separation wall covered in graffiti. One piece reads: "To Exist is to Resist." The slogan captures something essential about how conatus operates under occupation—existence itself becomes political.]
</div>
```

### 6. Justice in Hebrew/Arabic (Linguistic Analysis)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="40">
The Hebrew <em>tzedek</em> and Arabic <em>'adl</em> both carry meanings that "justice" doesn't quite capture. <em>Tzedek</em> shares a root with <em>tzaddik</em> (righteous one) and suggests straightness, correctness. <em>'Adl</em> implies balance, equilibrium, setting straight. Both assume something can be made properly aligned.
</div>
```

### 7. Kanafani Quote (Palestinian Voice)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="45">
<em>"The Palestinian is asked to be reasonable, to accept what reason demands. But whose reason? Reason itself comes dressed in the uniform of the occupier."</em><br>—Ghassan Kanafani (approximate citation)
</div>
```

### 8. Original Position Critique (Philosophical Doubt)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="50">
But who gets to be "anyone"? The original position assumes subjects who could imagine being each other. Can the settler imagine being the refugee? Can the refugee imagine being the settler? Some positions seem mutually constitutive through exclusion.
</div>
```

### 9. Arabic Justice Etymology (Linguistic)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="52">
The Arabic <em>'adala</em> (justice) shares a root with <em>'adila</em> (to deviate, to turn away). As if justice were always a turning from the established path, a deviation from what is toward what calls.
</div>
```

### 10. Checkpoint Scene (Political Reality)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="55">
At a checkpoint, a soldier faces a Palestinian woman. Her face makes a demand. Behind her, a line of others waiting. Behind the soldier, orders, protocols, the state's demands. Where is the face-to-face here? Who is the third? Everyone is already the third.
</div>
```

### 11. Justice Demand (Political Urgency)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="58">
"WE DEMAND JUSTICE!" CHANTED AT EVERY DEMONSTRATION. BUT WHAT ARRIVES IS ALWAYS LAW, PROCEDURE, COMPROMISE. THE DEMAND REMAINS, INEXHAUSTIBLE. THE MORE LAW WE CREATE, THE MORE JUSTICE WITHDRAWS.
</div>
```

### 12. Instagram Break (Personal Crisis)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="60">
Posted to Instagram, 11:47 PM. By midnight, the exclusions were unbearable. Every name invoked—Kant, Hegel, Derrida—summoned a hundred unnamed others. The comment that triggered the break: "Where is Fanon? Where is Said? Where is Darwish? Are Palestinians only objects of analysis, never subjects of thought?"
</div>
```

### 13. Missing Palestinian Voices (Shame)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="62">
The original Instagram story, now deleted, had no Palestinian voices until someone commented: "You're 2,000 words in and haven't quoted a single Palestinian thinker." The shame was immediate, bodily. The very structure of the analysis—beginning with Spinoza, moving through German philosophy—reproduced the colonial gesture of bringing European thought to bear on native problems.
</div>
```

### 14. The Break Point (Writing Crisis)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="65">
The break happened here. Between typing these names and continuing. The weight of them. Each name a library, a life, a world of thought. How dare I proceed having merely listed them? Yet how dare I claim to "include" them, as if inclusion were mine to grant?
</div>
```

### 15. Fanon Quote (Decolonial Theory)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="67">
<em>"The colonized intellectual who writes for his people ought to use the past with the intention of opening the future"</em>—Fanon. But I am not colonized, and these are not my people. What right have I to use anyone's past? What future am I opening or foreclosing?
</div>
```

### 16. Marx's Anti-Semitism (Historical Irony)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="70">
/* The bitter irony: Marx's own text participates in the anti-Semitism it claims to diagnose. His "Jewish Question" becomes part of the arsenal used against Jews, even as his analysis of formal versus real emancipation illuminates Palestinian dispossession. Texts betray themselves, carry poisons alongside their remedies. */
</div>
```

### 17. Kanafani on Universal Struggle (Solidarity)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="72">
Ghassan Kanafani: <em>"The Palestinian cause is not a cause for Palestinians only, but a cause for every revolutionary, wherever he is, as a cause of the exploited and oppressed masses in our era."</em> The particular struggle becomes universal not through abstraction but through solidarity.
</div>
```

### 18. Darwish on Home (Poetry)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="74">
Perhaps the most honest position is Darwish's: <em>"I have learned and dismantled all the words in order to draw from them a / single word: Home."</em> The dismantling is never complete, the home never simply present.
</div>
```

### 19. Derrida Critique (Philosophical Doubt)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="76">
And Derrida? He demystifies presence itself but mystifies the "perhaps," the "à venir," as if undecidability were a kind of decision, as if the impossibility of justice were its possibility. Every critique generates its own ghosts.
</div>
```

### 20. ID Card Colors (Bureaucratic Violence)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="78">
Palestinian ID cards: Green for West Bank. Blue for Gaza. Orange for residents of Jerusalem who are not citizens. Each color marks a different degree of rightlessness. Arendt would recognize this taxonomy immediately.
</div>
```

### 21. Sheikh Jarrah Protests (Political Action)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="80">
THE JOINT PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI DEMONSTRATIONS AT SHEIKH JARRAH CREATED, BRIEFLY, SOMETHING LIKE ARENDTIAN SPACES. JEWS AND ARABS ACTING TOGETHER, NOT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES BUT THROUGH THEM. THE ISRAELI STATE RESPONDED WITH VIOLENCE PRECISELY BECAUSE SUCH SPACES THREATEN SOVEREIGNTY'S LOGIC MORE THAN ANY ARMED RESISTANCE COULD.
</div>
```

### 22. Jewish Political Tradition (Arendt Critique)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="81">
<em>"The tragedy of the Jewish people is that they have no tradition of political action as distinguished from religious tradition"</em>—Arendt. The tragedy of the Palestinian people might be that their political tradition gets reduced to national liberation as distinguished from other forms of collective action.
</div>
```

### 23. The Violence of "We" (Community)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="82">
Every "we" is a violence. Every "we" is also a possibility. Arendt knew both things simultaneously.
</div>
```

### 24. Tikkun Olam vs Sumud (Metaphysics)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="83">
The Hebrew <em>tikkun olam</em>—repairing the world—assumes the world can be repaired. The Arabic <em>sumud</em>—steadfastness—assumes it must be endured. Which metaphysics is more violent: the belief in repair or the acceptance of damage?
</div>
```

### 25. Wall Graffiti (Urgent Voice)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="84">
"WE CANNOT WAIT FOR PHILOSOPHERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO. WE ARE DYING NOW."—GRAFFITI ON THE SEPARATION WALL
</div>
```

### 26. Distributed Exception (Legal Plurality)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="85">
/* The Palestinian villages that maintain their own informal legal systems alongside Israeli military law and Palestinian Authority regulations practice something like distributed exception—multiple, overlapping, incomplete authorities that create spaces for maneuver. */
</div>
```

### 27. Darwish on Cause/People (Transformation)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="86">
Mahmoud Darwish: <em>"We have triumphed. They have transformed us from a Cause into a people, from a people into a Cause, from a Cause into a people..."</em> The transformation never completes, never stabilizes.
</div>
```

### 28. Language Politics (Resistance)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="87">
The question of language is never just methodological. In Palestine, to speak Arabic is resistance. In Israel, to refuse Hebrew is betrayal. Every word chooses sides even when it claims neutrality.
</div>
```

### 29. Return of the Dead (Haunting)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="88">
Every Palestinian knows this scene. The dead return nightly—in dreams, in memories, in the names of streets that no longer exist. How do you speak to what shouldn't be there but is?
</div>
```

### 30. Different Ghosts (Languages of Haunting)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="89">
Arabic has words for different kinds of ghosts: <em>jinn</em> (beings of smokeless fire), <em>afreet</em> (powerful spirits), <em>ruh</em> (soul/spirit). Hebrew has <em>dybbuk</em> (clinging spirit), <em>ruach</em> (wind/spirit), <em>neshamah</em> (breath/soul). Each language knows haunting differently.
</div>
```

### 31. Choosing Ghosts (Unknown Voice)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="90">
"We do not choose our ghosts. They choose us."—Translation uncertain, heard in a Jerusalem cafe, speaker unknown.
</div>
```

### 32. Naming Violence (Israel-Palestine)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="91">
/* The very phrase "Israel-Palestine" performs a cut. "Israel/Palestine" suggests division. "Israel-Palestine" suggests hyphenation. "Historic Palestine" erases. "The Holy Land" sanctifies. Every naming is already a taking of sides. */
</div>
```

### 33. Checkpoint Hermeneutics (Reading for Survival)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="92">
At the checkpoint, everyone becomes a scholar of documents. The soldier reads papers for authenticity. The Palestinian reads the soldier's mood. Both are hermeneuts of survival. Both know that interpretation can kill.
</div>
```

### 34. Paleonymy Without the Word (Haunted Names)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="93">
Every Palestinian knows paleonymy without the word. "Haifa" spoken in exile means something different than "Haifa" on Israeli maps. Same word, haunted differently. The Arabic "Yafa" and the Hebrew "Yafo"—old names for Jaffa, each carrying different ghosts.
</div>
```

### 35. Nietzsche on Words (Cemetery)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="94">
"Every word is a prejudice"—Nietzsche. Every word is also a cemetery.
</div>
```

### 36. Ctrl+Alt+Delete (Computer Language)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="95">
AT QALANDIA CHECKPOINT, GRAFFITI IN ENGLISH: "CTRL+ALT+DELETE." COMPUTER LANGUAGE REPURPOSED AS POLITICAL CRITIQUE. THE OCCUPATION AS A SYSTEM ERROR REQUIRING FORCED RESTART.
</div>
```

### 37. From River to Sea (Contested Phrase)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="96">
GRAFFITI NEAR BETHLEHEM: "FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA." FOUR ENGLISH WORDS THAT MEAN LIBERATION TO SOME, ANNIHILATION TO OTHERS. NO AMOUNT OF PHILOSOPHICAL SOPHISTICATION RESOLVES THIS DIFFERENCE.
</div>
```

### 38. Writing Breaks Again (Metaphysical Presence)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="97">
Here the writing broke again. "Make resistance legible to itself"—as if resistance could achieve self-presence, self-transparency, self-knowledge. As if theory were a mirror. The metaphysics of presence returning through the back door of political hope.
</div>
```

### 39. Resistance vs Collaboration (Failed Categories)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="98">
Even "resistance" assumes too much. The Palestinian who works in an Israeli settlement to feed their family while refusing to speak Hebrew—are they resisting or collaborating? The terms themselves fail where they matter most.
</div>
```

### 40. Sumud (Untranslatable Resistance)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="99">
The Arabic word <em>sumud</em> (steadfastness) resists translation. To translate it as "resistance" makes it too active. To translate it as "endurance" makes it too passive. The word does its political work precisely by refusing the active/passive distinction that Western political theory assumes. Some paleonyms teach by refusing to travel.
</div>
```

### 41. Weaponized Visibility (Checkpoint Surveillance)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="100">
/* At the Qalandiya checkpoint, visibility is weaponized. Watchtowers, cameras, searchlights. To be seen is to be captured in a system of control. Yet Palestinians also say: "To exist is to resist." Making yourself visible becomes political action. The eye cuts both ways. */
</div>
```

### 42. Light/Enlightenment (Double Meaning)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="102">
The Arabic word <em>noor</em> means both light and enlightenment. The Hebrew <em>or</em> carries the same double meaning. Both traditions know that illumination can blind.
</div>
```

### 43. Cogito and Colonial Subject (Cartesian Critique)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="104">
"Cogito ergo sum"—I think therefore I am. The foundational certainty arrives through introspection, the mind's eye seeing itself. Yet who is this "I" that thinks? Already abstracted from body, place, language, others. The colonial subject avant la lettre.
</div>
```

### 44. Desert Falcon Surveillance (AI Occupation)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="106">
/* Israel's surveillance system, marketed as "Desert Falcon," uses AI to analyze footage from thousands of cameras. The occupation perfects panopticism—yet Palestinians have learned to make surveillance visible, painting cameras, mapping their positions, creating apps to track checkpoints. Counter-surveillance as resistance. */
</div>
```

### 45. Visual Metaphors (Trapped in Optics)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="108">
We write about the tyranny of the eye using visual metaphors—"emerge," "appear," "examine," "illuminate." The critique sees itself through the very optics it questions. There is no outside to this architecture, only the possibility of dwelling differently within it.
</div>
```

### 46. Chanted Voices (Collective Sound)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="110">
AT PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, VOICES MERGE INTO CHANTS: "WITH SPIRIT, WITH BLOOD, WE SACRIFICE FOR YOU PALESTINE." THE INDIVIDUAL VOICE DISAPPEARS INTO COLLECTIVE SOUND. YET ISRAELI FORCES RECORD THESE VOICES, USE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE, BUILD DATABASES OF DISSENT. THE COMMUNAL BREATH BECOMES DATA.
</div>
```

### 47. Oral History (Voice vs Text)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="112">
"The Palestinian narrative is oral history passed between generations"—but immediately recorded, transcribed, published. Every testimony becomes text. The voice seeks to preserve what writing might betray, yet needs writing to survive.
</div>
```

### 48. Exiled Poets (Orphaned Words)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="114">
Palestinian poets in exile write in Arabic for readers who may not read Arabic. Their words are orphaned twice—cut off from their land, from their language. Yet these orphan texts carry what the living voice cannot: the possibility of return through readers not yet born.
</div>
```

### 49. Military Court Testimony (Bulletproof Glass)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="116">
Palestinian witnesses at Israeli military courts testify through bulletproof glass, their voices transmitted electronically. The architecture ensures the voice arrives without presence, testimony without the possibility of being heard as human.
</div>
```

### 50. Sam/Dawa (Medicine/Poison)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="118">
Hebrew <em>sam</em> means both medicine and poison. Arabic <em>dawa'</em> carries the same ambiguity. Languages know what philosophy tries to forget: the cure contains its own danger.
</div>
```

### 51. Turing Test (Language Uses Us)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="120">
The Turing Test assumes we can distinguish human from machine by how they use language. But what if language uses us? What if both human and machine are effects of iterability, not its origins?
</div>
```

### 52. Palestinian Documentation (Video Evidence)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="122">
/* Palestinians document everything—every demolition, every arrest, every olive tree uprooted. They know voices disappear, witnesses die, but video remains. Yet Israeli courts often reject Palestinian video evidence as "edited," "without context," "unverifiable." The regime of truth still demands something like presence, even as it operates through pure inscription. */
</div>
```

### 53. Writing Speaks (Impossible Phrase)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="124">
"Writing speaks"—an impossible phrase that we cannot not use. Language is haunted by the ghost of speech even in its most written form. Perhaps especially there.
</div>
```

### 54. Khader Adnan (Body as Text)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="126">
KHADER ADNAN, PALESTINIAN PRISONER, DIED AFTER 87 DAYS OF HUNGER STRIKE IN 2023. HIS BODY HAD BECOME A TEXT THAT ISRAELI AUTHORITIES COULDN'T STOP READING, COULDN'T STOP RESPONDING TO. EVEN IN DEATH, THE INSCRIPTION REMAINS, CITED BY OTHERS WHO REFUSE FOOD.
</div>
```

### 55. Exist is Resist (Graffiti Citation)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="128">
"To exist is to resist" appears on walls throughout Palestine. The graffiti iterates, spreads, becomes a citation that any wall can bear. Writing about writing about existing.
</div>
```

### 56. Khatt (Line/Writing)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="130">
The Arabic word <em>khatt</em> means both "line" and "writing." To draw a line is already to write. The Green Line, the separation wall, the checkpoint queue—all are forms of violent inscription that Palestinians must read and rewrite daily.
</div>
```

### 57. Violence as Writing (Theoretical Aporia)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="132">
Here I stopped, unable to write about violence as writing without seeming to aestheticize horror. The theoretical frame threatens to make suffering abstract. Yet isn't this what violence does—inscribe messages on bodies, write sovereignty through blood? The aporia isn't just theoretical.
</div>
```

### 58. Actions Write (Hermeneutics)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="134">
The stone thrown, the tree planted, the wall built, the home demolished—each act writes. But who reads? And in what language? The hermeneutics of political action means every inscription remains open to interpretation, to reading otherwise.
</div>
```

### 59. 418 Villages (Aporia of Witness)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="4" data-scroll-trigger="136">
EVERY PALESTINIAN VILLAGE DESTROYED IN 1948 HAD A NAME. 418 VILLAGES. I HAVE NOT NAMED THEM. CANNOT NAME THEM HERE. THE LIST WOULD BE ANOTHER VIOLENCE—REDUCTION OF LIVED WORLDS TO TOPONYMS. YET NOT LISTING THEM IS ALSO VIOLENCE—ERASURE REDUX. THE APORIA OF WITNESS.
</div>
```

### 60. Named Women (Margins)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="2" data-scroll-trigger="138">
Rifqa Abu Laban, killed protecting her home from demolition. Fadwa Tuqan, poet of resistance. Rachel Corrie, crushed by a bulldozer. Names that appear only in margins, as if their struggles were supplementary.
</div>
```

### 61. Colonial Archive Logic (Comprehensiveness)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="1" data-scroll-trigger="140">
/* The very desire to be comprehensive reproduces the colonial archive's logic—the dream of total knowledge, complete documentation, nothing left outside the text. */
</div>
```

### 62. Unbacked Currency (Sovereignty)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="5" data-scroll-trigger="142">
The Bank of Palestine issues currency no state backs. The Israeli shekel circulates in territories Israel claims not to govern. Money, like language, reveals sovereignties the official maps deny.
</div>
```

### 63. Mixed Cities (Daily Negotiations)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="left" data-voice="3" data-scroll-trigger="144">
In Haifa, in Jaffa, in Acre—mixed cities where the conflict is both most intense and most banal. Daily life proceeds through a thousand small negotiations this analysis cannot capture. The greeting in whichever language seems safer. The landlord who doesn't ask surnames. The taxi driver who changes radio stations depending on passengers.
</div>
```

### 64. Final Margin (Bad Faith Catalog)
```html
<div class="marginalia-voice" data-position="right" data-voice="6" data-scroll-trigger="146">
This catalogue of exclusions could continue indefinitely. At some point, the gesture of acknowledging what's excluded becomes its own form of bad faith—as if listing omissions could somehow include them. The remainder remains. It must.
</div>
```

## Voice Type Guide:
- **Voice 1** (Green, JetBrains Mono): Technical/systemic critique
- **Voice 2** (Cyan, Share Tech Mono, italic): Quoted theorists, citations  
- **Voice 3** (Purple, light weight): Authorial self-doubt, reflexive critique
- **Voice 4** (Red, uppercase, small): Political urgency, anger
- **Voice 5** (Orange, faded): Historical context, linguistic analysis
- **Voice 6** (Pink, underlined): Questions that challenge the main text

## Positioning Strategy:
- Alternates left/right to create visual balance
- Earlier marginalia uses lower scroll triggers (15-50%)
- Later marginalia accelerates (80-146%) to create invasion effect
- Strategic clustering at moments of textual crisis

## Effect Created:
The marginalia starts sparse and scholarly, then becomes increasingly urgent and invasive, ultimately overwhelming the main text with multiple voices that refuse the philosophical frame's authority. This performs the essay's argument about how every attempt at systematic analysis breaks against the political realities it tries to contain.
