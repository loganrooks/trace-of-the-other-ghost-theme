# **From Particular Critique to Fundamental Questions: Sovereignty, Justice, and the Political**

*These fragments emerged first as Instagram stories—those disappearing images that promise presence only to ensure absence. Posted, interrupted, withdrawn, apologized for, supplemented. What follows preserves the scars of that emergence. The GAP you will encounter marks where the writing discovered its own violence and broke. Each return to these words opens the wound again.*

*Philosophy demands patience. In an economy of scrolling and skimming, choosing to dwell becomes almost subversive. You are invited to read in fragments, to skip and return, to find your own path through. There is no proper way through this text, only ways.*

## **Opening: The Scene of Writing**

I write this from a particular place—a desk, a room, a city whose safety is built on others' vulnerability. Outside this window, life continues its ordinary rhythm while my screen fills with extraordinary violence. Gaza. Jerusalem. Nablus. Names that arrive as notifications, as death counts, as arguments about arguments about suffering.

The obscenity of philosophical comfort strikes me daily. Here I sit, summoning Derrida and Levinas, while others count their dead. By what right does anyone write about wounds they haven't borne? Yet silence feels like another violence—the comfortable abstention of those who can afford to look away.

"My particular criticisms of Israel"—this is how an earlier version of this writing began. Already that "my" assumes too much, claims a possession over critique that belongs to no one and everyone. Already "Israel" appears as if we all know what that name contains, what borders it draws, whose existence it affirms and whose it negates. We haven't even reached the first sentence and already the violence has begun.

What follows will be long. In patient, sometimes exhausting detail, we will trace how every political vocabulary we inherit carries within it the seeds of the violence it claims to oppose. The demand for sovereignty—whether Israeli or Palestinian, whether ethnic or civic, whether partisan or universal—seems to promise protection, self-determination, justice. Yet each attempt to achieve sovereign presence creates new ghosts, new exclusions, new forms of rightlessness.

Some readers will find this abstract, a philosophical luxury when people need liberation now. Others will recognize in this abstraction the only way to approach wounds too fresh for direct touch. Both responses are justified. Both miss something essential.

The Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish once wrote of being "present at the absence of a place." This paradox—presence at absence—captures something philosophy usually flees from. How do you write about a conflict where presence itself is the stakes? Where one people's return is another's displacement? Where the promise of safety creates new forms of danger?

Starting from my "particular criticisms" means acknowledging that every beginning is already compromised. The critique of Israeli policies leads necessarily to questioning the state form itself, which leads to questioning sovereignty, which leads to questioning the very ground on which any political community claims to stand. Each step of this trajectory feels both necessary and violent—necessary because the logic demands it, violent because it abstracts from particular suffering toward universal categories.

Yet perhaps abstraction, carefully practiced, becomes a different kind of attention. To think sovereignty *as such* means to recognize its operation not just in Israeli settlements or Palestinian resistance, but in the very desire for a solution, for a final answer that would make the conflict past rather than present. The dream of resolution—whether through partition, confederation, or single states—carries within it the same metaphysical commitment: that somewhere, somehow, presence without remainder is possible.

[m][2 1.1 28 r][*"Every time I write 'Israel' or 'Palestine,' I perform a cut in the world. These names are not descriptions but acts of political force."*—*Edward Said*]

What you're about to read emerged in pieces, each one discovering the violence of what came before. Originally I thought I could move smoothly from particular to universal, from critique of specific policies to fundamental questions about political life. That smoothness itself was a kind of violence, assuming connections where there were only wounds.

So the writing broke. Between sections, sometimes within them, gaps opened that couldn't be sutured. The philosophical apparatus I was constructing to analyze sovereignty kept revealing its own imperial tendencies—the way analysis itself claims sovereignty over its objects, the way critique assumes a position outside what it critiques.

Derrida writes somewhere that justice is the experience of the impossible—the necessity of deciding without adequate knowledge, of acting without guarantee, of judging without absolute criteria. Every word that follows participates in this impossibility. To write about Israel-Palestine means to cut, to choose, to exclude. Each sentence creates its remainder. Each analysis produces new ghosts.

The tradition we call "Western philosophy" offers powerful tools for thinking about sovereignty, violence, exclusion. Yet these tools emerge from the very tradition that produced the colonial state form now wreaking havoc in the Middle East. Can the master's tools dismantle the master's house? Audre Lorde said no. Yet here we are, tool in hand, hoping that using them against themselves might open something else.

What follows will be patient, sometimes maddeningly so. We will dwell with Plato's cave and Rousseau's voice, with Marx's ghosts and Fanon's violence. Each thinker will be allowed to speak, then interrupted by voices they couldn't hear or chose to silence. The goal is neither synthesis nor adjudication but something more modest and more radical: to understand how the very frameworks we use to think justice might be part of what makes justice impossible.

[m][5 1.4 35 l][A photograph of an uprooted olive tree, no caption]

Spinoza called *conatus* the striving by which each thing endeavors to persevere in its being. For him, this wasn't good or evil, simply necessary—the condition of existence itself. Every political body, every state, every community acts to maintain itself. The question is how this drive toward self-preservation becomes organized. Does it collapse into paranoid exclusion of any perceived threat? Or might it open onto what Spinoza envisioned—a rational collective power that enhances rather than diminishes life?

The tragedy of our current moment is how the legitimate need for protection—Jewish historical trauma, Palestinian dispossession—gets channeled through political forms that can only secure one people's presence by ensuring another's absence. Each side's *conatus*, its striving to persevere, becomes the other's existential threat.

Philosophy cannot solve this. These words offer no blueprint for peace, no roadmap beyond the current horror. What they might offer is a different way of understanding why every proposed solution seems to reproduce the problem it meant to solve. If sovereignty itself—the very form through which we organize political life—carries within it the seeds of exclusion and violence, then perhaps we need to think political community otherwise.

Otherwise than sovereignty—what would that mean? The question itself resists answer, and that resistance might be where we need to dwell. In the space between the necessary and the impossible, between the demand for justice and the recognition that justice cannot be simply achieved, something else might emerge.

Perhaps.

## **Movement I: The Trajectory and Its Ghosts**

### **Section 1: The Initial Thesis**

The movement from particular critique to fundamental questioning rarely announces itself. You begin by objecting to specific policies—a checkpoint here, a settlement there—and find yourself pulled by the logic of your own analysis toward questions about the state form itself. Then the state form reveals its dependence on sovereignty. Then sovereignty shows itself as one manifestation of something even more fundamental: what Spinoza called the *conatus*, that striving by which each thing endeavors to persevere in its being.[^5]

[m][6 1.6 35 r][Already this "you" assumes too much. Who is this subject who begins with particular critique? The comfortable critic? The situated observer? The claim to begin anywhere already claims too much.]

This trajectory might seem like philosophical ambition, the academic tendency to inflate every local problem into a universal principle. Yet something in the structure of the Israel-Palestine conflict resists containment within particular boundaries. Each attempt to define the conflict's limits—geographical, temporal, conceptual—breaks against realities that exceed those limits. The refugee camps speak of 1948 while the settlements speak of biblical time. International law speaks of 1967 borders while facts on the ground create other geometries entirely.[^6]

Consider how Spinoza's *conatus* illuminates this resistance to containment. For Spinoza, the striving to persevere isn't a choice but the very definition of existence—"the actual essence of the thing itself."[^7] A political body that didn't strive to maintain itself would cease to exist. This seems to naturalize political violence, to make it as inevitable as gravity. Yet Spinoza's insight cuts deeper. The *conatus* can be organized rationally or passionally, toward collective flourishing or paranoid self-enclosure.[^8]

[m][4 2.2 15 l]["Every appeal to Spinoza in discussions of Israel-Palestine carries its own bitter irony. The philosopher of radical democracy becomes the name of a street in a settlement. His ethics of joy becomes a justification for occupation. How texts travel, how they betray themselves in their applications..."]

The tragedy—if we can still use that word without aestheticizing horror—is that both Israeli and Palestinian political formations channel legitimate existential needs through structures that make those needs mutually exclusive. Jewish historical trauma, culminating in but not limited to the Holocaust, creates a demand for guaranteed refuge that crystallizes into the demand for ethnic sovereignty.[^9] Palestinian dispossession, the *Nakba* and its ongoing elaboration, generates a parallel demand for return and self-determination.[^10] Each people's *conatus*, its striving to persevere, becomes legible to the other only as existential threat.

Here the philosophical analysis encounters its first aporia. To trace how particular grievances become universal principles risks abstracting from real suffering toward bloodless categories. Yet to remain at the level of particular grievances means accepting the terms that make the conflict irresolvable. The checkpoint is never just a checkpoint—it's sovereignty performing itself. The suicide bombing is never just desperate violence—it's the return of what sovereignty tried to exclude. Every particular carries within it the trace of the universal structure that makes it possible.[^11]

[m][4 1.8 35 r][A photograph of the separation wall covered in graffiti. One piece reads: "To Exist is to Resist." The slogan captures something essential about how *conatus* operates under occupation—existence itself becomes political.]

Perhaps the question needs reframing. Rather than asking whether we should move from particular to universal, we might ask what happens when that movement is recognized as inevitable yet violent. The critique of specific Israeli policies—administrative detention, house demolitions, the permit system—pulls analysis toward questioning the security logic that justifies them.[^12] That security logic reveals itself as inseparable from maintaining demographic ratios, which reveals the ethnic definition of the state, which reveals sovereignty as fundamentally about deciding who belongs and who doesn't.[^13]

The same movement occurs from the other direction. Questioning specific forms of Palestinian resistance leads to examining the conditions that make resistance necessary, which leads to the structure of occupation, which leads back to sovereignty as the power to place others outside the law's protection while remaining within its authorization.[^14]

### **Section 2: Traditional Justice and the Metaphysics of Presence**

Justice appears first as an intuition of wrongness. Something has been taken that should be returned. Someone has been harmed who should be made whole. A balance has been disturbed that needs restoration. These intuitions feel immediate, natural, as if justice were simply the name for setting things right. Yet each attempt to specify what "setting right" means reveals commitments that run deeper than argument—metaphysical assumptions about what can be present, complete, achieved.[^15]

[m][5 1.2 38 l][The Hebrew *tzedek* and Arabic *'adl* both carry meanings that "justice" doesn't quite capture. *Tzedek* shares a root with *tzaddik* (righteous one) and suggests straightness, correctness. *'Adl* implies balance, equilibrium, setting straight. Both assume something can be made properly aligned.]

Consider how Kant's monumental architecture of *Recht* operates. The human being appears as split—phenomenal body subject to natural causation, noumenal soul capable of moral freedom.[^16] From this split emerges the entire apparatus of justice: because we are free, we can be held responsible; because we are embodied, we need external laws to coordinate our actions; because we are rational, we can consent to limitations on our freedom that enable everyone's freedom to coexist.[^17] The state becomes the mechanism through which the moral law translates itself into enforceable rules. Justice is achieved when institutions finally correspond to what reason demands.

[m][4 1.7 65 r]["The Palestinian is asked to be reasonable, to accept what reason demands. But whose reason? Reason itself comes dressed in the uniform of the occupier."—*Ghassan Kanafani* (approximate citation)]

The elegance of this solution conceals its founding violence. The "person" whose rights need protecting is already an abstraction—stripped of history, culture, language, land. To become a subject of rights, you must first be reduced to what all rational beings share.[^18] Your particular wounds, your specific dispossession, the names of your dead—these become accidentally yours rather than essentially. Justice promises to restore what was taken, but only after transforming both you and what you lost into juridical categories.

Hegel seems to recognize this violence. His system promises to overcome Kantian abstraction through dialectical movement that preserves while transcending particularity.[^19] Justice emerges through historical development: from Abstract Right (property relations) through Morality (conscience) to *Sittlichkeit*, ethical life embodied in concrete institutions—family, civil society, the state.[^20] The rational state doesn't impose external rules on resistant subjects; it actualizes the freedom that subjects unconsciously seek. When Palestinian farmers resist the appropriation of their land, when Israeli settlers claim biblical authorization for their presence, both are moments in freedom's self-realization through contradiction.[^21]

[+][The application of Hegelian logic to Israel-Palestine reveals its obscenity most clearly in certain liberal Zionist arguments that frame the conflict as a necessary stage in historical development. The Palestinian becomes a "moment" to be overcome in the march toward rational statehood. This reading appears explicitly in some interpretations of Israel as representing "progress" against "traditional" Palestinian society. See Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin, "Exile, History and the Nationalization of Jewish Memory," in *Exile and Return: Predicaments of Palestinians and Jews*, eds. Ann M. Lesch and Ian S. Lustick (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), pp. 165-186, for a critique of how Hegelian progress narratives function in Zionist historiography.]

Yet even Hegel's dynamic system assumes that reconciliation is possible, that the state can become adequate to freedom, that institutions can fully embody ethical life. The achievement might be deferred, might require historical labor, but the *telos* remains: a condition where justice would be present, accomplished, no longer a question but an answer.

Rawls offers perhaps the most sophisticated contemporary version of this dream. Behind the veil of ignorance, stripped of knowledge about our particular identities, we would choose principles that protect everyone because we might be anyone.[^22] The thought experiment generates two principles: maximum equal liberty and the difference principle (inequalities justified only if they benefit the worst off).[^23] Justice becomes fairness, and fairness becomes what rational agents would choose if they couldn't game the system to their advantage.

[m][6 1.4 35 l][But who gets to be "anyone"? The original position assumes subjects who could imagine being each other. Can the settler imagine being the refugee? Can the refugee imagine being the settler? Some positions seem mutually constitutive through exclusion.]

Each of these frameworks—Kantian, Hegelian, Rawlsian—shares what Derrida identified as a metaphysics of presence.[^24] They assume justice can be made present: as correspondence between law and reason, as reconciliation of particular and universal, as principles that rational agents would affirm. The differences between them matter less than their shared assumption: somewhere, somehow, through proper procedures or historical development or ideal deliberation, justice can arrive. The wound can be healed. The ledger can be balanced. Presence can be restored.

This metaphysical commitment shapes how we read every particular injustice. A house demolished in East Jerusalem becomes a violation of property rights that should be restored.[^25] A suicide bombing in Tel Aviv becomes a crime that demands punishment.[^26] Each event gets processed through frameworks that promise eventual resolution—legal remedy, historical development, rational deliberation. Yet what if the wound is structured such that no healing would be justice? What if the ledger contains entries that cannot be balanced? What if presence itself—the very dream of it—generates the violence it claims to cure?

### **Section 3: Derrida's An-archic Justice**

Justice "*à venir*"—to come—carries a peculiar temporality that resists both presence and absence. The French construction preserves an ambiguity that English translations strain to capture: neither simply future nor perpetually deferred, neither messianic promise nor empty horizon.[^27] Through patient readings of Levinas, through engagements with law's founding violence, through encounters with Marx's specters, Derrida uncovers justice as what haunts every legal arrangement without ever allowing itself to be housed within one.[^28]

[m][5 1.4 38 r][The Arabic *'adala* (justice) shares a root with *'adila* (to deviate, to turn away). As if justice were always a turning from the established path, a deviation from what is toward what calls.]

The approach begins with an encounter—Levinas's face-to-face with the Other whose vulnerability makes an infinite demand.[^29] Before any calculation, before any law, the face says: "Thou shalt not kill." This prohibition arrives without justification, without context, without possibility of negotiation. Here would be ethics in its purity: infinite responsibility to the singular Other who faces me in their absolute alterity.[^30]

Yet Derrida reads Levinas against himself, or perhaps with him toward conclusions Levinas hesitates to draw. Language itself—the very medium through which the Other addresses me—already involves a certain violence.[^31] To speak is to use general terms, to translate singularity into signs that pre-exist this encounter. The saying gets betrayed by the said. Worse, or perhaps better: the moment a third person appears—*le tiers*—the infinite responsibility becomes impossible.[^32] How can I respond infinitely to this Other when that Other also faces me with infinite demand? The face-to-face breaks into multiplicity, comparison, the need for measure.

[m][4 1.5 45 l][At a checkpoint, a soldier faces a Palestinian woman. Her face makes a demand. Behind her, a line of others waiting. Behind the soldier, orders, protocols, the state's demands. Where is the face-to-face here? Who is the third? Everyone is already the third.]

This multiplication doesn't corrupt some original purity—it reveals that purity never existed. We are always already in the realm of the third, always already caught between infinite responsibility and finite capacity to respond. Justice names this impossible experience: the necessity of comparing incomparables, of calculating the incalculable, of making decisions without adequate criteria.[^33]

Consider how law attempts to manage this impossibility. Every legal system claims to derive authority from some founding moment—a constitution, a revolution, a divine revelation.[^34] Yet that founding moment was itself neither legal nor illegal; it preceded the very distinction it establishes. The violence that founds law cannot be judged by the law it founds. This isn't a flaw that better institutional design could fix. Every system of justice rests on what Derrida calls a "mystical foundation"—mystical because it cannot justify itself through the very rationality it institutes.[^35]

[+][The founding of Israel in 1948 exemplifies this mystical foundation with terrible clarity. The Declaration of Independence claims authority from "natural and historic right," from UN Resolution 181, from the Holocaust's moral imperative—yet none of these fully authorize what happened. The *Nakba*—the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians—was neither legal nor illegal under a law that didn't yet exist. Palestinian refugees carry documents from a state that no longer exists, claiming rights under a law that never recognized their dispossession as illegal. Both peoples invoke justice while standing on the abyss of law's founding violence. See Ilan Pappé, *The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine* (Oneworld, 2006\) and Benny Morris, *The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited* (Cambridge University Press, 2004\) for competing narratives that both reveal law's groundlessness.]

Between the incalculable demand of justice and the calculating machinery of law, an aporia opens that cannot be closed. Law must calculate—it requires general rules, comparable cases, predictable procedures. Justice calls for absolute singularity—this case, this person, this irreducible situation.[^36] A judge who only applies rules isn't judging; they're computing. Yet a judge who decides without rules commits arbitrary violence. Every just decision must pass through this impossible passage: conserving law while suspending it, applying rules while reinventing them.[^37]

The temporality of "*à venir*" emerges from this structural impossibility. Justice cannot be present because presence would mean calculation completed, the ledger balanced, the case closed. Yet justice isn't simply absent or endlessly deferred. Each decision, each act, each judgment happens in the shadow of this impossible demand. We act without guarantee, decide without adequate knowledge, judge without absolute criteria—and in this impossibility, justice insists.[^38]

[m][4 1.5 60 l]["We demand justice\!" chanted at every demonstration. But what arrives is always law, procedure, compromise. The demand remains, inexhaustible. The more law we create, the more justice withdraws. Or perhaps: the more justice insists.]

Derrida's strangest, most difficult insight: this impossibility is justice's chance. If justice could be calculated, programmed, made present, it would cease to be justice and become mere administration. The undecidability that makes every decision an ordeal also keeps the question open, prevents any system from claiming to have achieved justice once and for all. The remainder—what gets excluded, who gets forgotten, which wounds stay unaddressed—returns as a spectral demand that no amount of law can fully satisfy.[^39]

Something shifts when we think justice this way. The Israeli legal system's claim to be "the only democracy in the Middle East" becomes legible as an attempt to present justice as achieved, institutional, present.[^40] The Palestinian appeal to international law becomes both necessary and insufficient—necessary because law offers the only available language for claim-making, insufficient because law cannot restore what was lost or calculate the value of dispossession.[^41] Both positions reveal justice as what exceeds every attempt to capture it, what haunts every claim to embody it.

The an-archic dimension appears here: justice operates without *archē*, without first principle or final ground.[^42] It has no essence to be realized, no content to be implemented. It names the permanent possibility that any arrangement might be otherwise, that any settlement remains unsettled, that every presence carries absence within it like a wound that won't close—or perhaps, more precisely, like a wound that shouldn't close, whose very openness keeps justice alive as question rather than answer.

## Movement II: The War of Inheritances

### **Section 4: The Apology and the Chorus**

The writing that continues cannot pretend wholeness. Each word now carries the weight of its exclusions, each sentence trembles with the voices it silences. An apology would be too easy—a gesture that absolves the one who apologizes while changing nothing in the structure that required apology. What's needed is something more difficult: to let the excluded interrupt from within, to allow the analysis to be reshaped by what it failed to think.[^55]

[m][2 1.2 30 l]["The colonized intellectual who writes for his people ought to use the past with the intention of opening the future"—Fanon. But I am not colonized, and these are not my people. What right have I to use anyone's past? What future am I opening or foreclosing?]

Start again. Marx stands in the British Museum, reading colonial reports from India, tracking how capital accumulates through dispossession.[^56] His vision of justice—"from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs"—emerges from witnessing how capitalism turns human capacity into commodity, human need into market demand.[^57] For Marx, the rights that Kant celebrates are the rights of the property owner, the "free" worker who owns nothing but their labor power, the citizen whose formal equality masks material subjection.[^58]

Listen to how Marx reads the "Jewish Question"—that awful, necessary text. He sees the split between political emancipation (formal rights) and human emancipation (actual freedom).[^59] The Jew can become a citizen while remaining excluded from Christian society. The worker can vote while being exploited. The Palestinian can, theoretically, be an Israeli citizen while living under military law.[^60] Rights don't dissolve oppression; they manage it, make it bearable, legitimate.

[m][1 1.2 35 r][The bitter irony: Marx's own text participates in the anti-Semitism it claims to diagnose. His "Jewish Question" becomes part of the arsenal used against Jews, even as his analysis of formal versus real emancipation illuminates Palestinian dispossession. Texts betray themselves, carry poisons alongside their remedies.]

And yet—Marx dreams of presence too. After the revolution, after private property is abolished, after the state withers away, humanity will achieve transparency to itself. No more fetishes, no more ideological mystifications, no more separation between essence and existence.[^61] The ghosts that haunt capitalism—value, commodity, capital itself—will be exorcised. Production will be rationally planned. Society will finally be what it is, without remainder.

**Fanon** interrupts this dream from the colony.

In the colony, violence isn't a stage to be overcome through historical development. Violence is the very structure through which humans are sorted into humans and sub-humans, those who can own property and those who are property, those whose violence is legitimate and those whose existence is violence.[^62] The colonized cannot achieve recognition through dialectical struggle because they aren't recognized as subjects capable of struggle. They exist in what Fanon calls "the zone of non-being."[^63]

[+][The "zone of non-being" maps with terrible precision onto the occupied territories. Area C, where Palestinians cannot build without permits that are never granted. Gaza, where calories are counted to maintain bare life. The refugee camps, permanent temporariness. These aren't metaphors for Fanon's analysis—they're its contemporary performance. See Achille Mbembe, "*Necropolitics*," trans. Libby Meintjes, *Public Culture* 15, no. 1 (2003): 11-40, for how sovereignty operates through the power to kill rather than the power to let live.]

Fanon's "new man" born from revolutionary violence seems to promise another presence—humanity finally achieved through the destruction of colonial categories.[^64] Yet read carefully: the new man is always emerging, never emerged. Decolonization is "quite simply the replacing of a certain 'species' of men by another 'species' of men"—but this replacement is a permanent process, not an achievement.[^65] The colony creates both colonizer and colonized; its destruction must be equally creative, equally ongoing.

[m][2 1.1 30 l][Ghassan Kanafani: "The Palestinian cause is not a cause for Palestinians only, but a cause for every revolutionary, wherever he is, as a cause of the exploited and oppressed masses in our era."[^66] The particular struggle becomes universal not through abstraction but through solidarity.]

**Said** writes from a different exile—not the revolutionary in the colony but the intellectual in the metropole, teaching *Heart of Darkness* at Columbia while Palestine burns.[^67] His *Orientalism* reveals how knowledge itself becomes a form of conquest. The Orient must be studied, classified, represented because it cannot represent itself. Palestinian refugees become objects of humanitarian discourse, their suffering measured in statistics, their politics reduced to terrorism or victimhood.[^68]

Yet Said also reaches for presence. His "secular criticism" promises a space outside ideology, a worldly engagement that escapes both religious dogma and nationalist mystification.[^69] The intellectual in exile achieves a kind of purity through displacement—belonging nowhere, they can see clearly. But this too is a metaphysics, as if exile were a position rather than a wound, as if criticism could find a place to stand outside the very ground it critiques.

[m][2 1.2 28 r][Perhaps the most honest position is Darwish's: "I have learned and dismantled all the words in order to draw from them a / single word: Home."[^70] The dismantling is never complete, the home never simply present.]

**Adorno and Horkheimer** write in Los Angeles, exiled from a Germany that tried to kill them, watching American films that remind them of Nazi propaganda.[^71] Their diagnosis: Enlightenment becomes mythology. Reason becomes instrumental reason. The project to demystify the world ends in total administration.[^72] Even resistance gets incorporated—marketed as rebellion, sold as authenticity.

Adorno's "negative dialectics" refuses any positive vision. To specify what freedom would look like is already to betray it. We can only know unfreedom, only criticize what is, never affirm what should be.[^73] Yet this refusal itself dreams of a presence—some space outside reification where critique remains pure, where thought doesn't become commodity, where the intellectual's distance guarantees insight.

**Each tradition critiques the others' metaphysical assumptions while harboring its own.**

Marx demystifies rights but mystifies revolution.  
Fanon demystifies colonial humanism but mystifies authentic violence.  
Said demystifies Orientalist knowledge but mystifies secular criticism.  
Adorno demystifies positive utopias but mystifies negative critique.

[m][2 1.1 28 l][And Derrida? He demystifies presence itself but mystifies the "perhaps," the "*à venir*," as if undecidability were a kind of decision, as if the impossibility of justice were its possibility. Every critique generates its own ghosts.]

The chorus grows louder: Benjamin's angel of history, blown backward into the future while wreckage piles at his feet.[^74] Arendt's "right to have rights," the paradox of needing political membership to claim universal human rights.[^75] Levinas's face that commands before any comprehension.[^76] Spivak asking if the subaltern can speak, knowing the question itself might silence them.[^77] Butler troubling the human/inhuman distinction that makes some lives grievable and others not.[^78]

What emerges from this cacophony isn't synthesis but something more difficult: the recognition that justice cannot be theorized from a single position, in a single voice, through a single tradition. Each perspective illuminates what others obscure, each critique enables and disables different possibilities. The Palestinian farmer facing eviction needs the language of rights even as that language transforms their dispossession into a legal case. The Israeli refusenik needs universal ethics even as universalism erases the particularity of occupation. We use the tools that fail us because failure might open something unexpected.

### **Section 5: Plurality, Worldliness, and the Space Between**

Hannah Arendt writes from multiple exiles—*German Jew* become American, philosopher become reporter, European become stateless refugee clutching papers that testified to what she was not.[^79] Her insight emerges from lived displacement: human rights mean nothing without a political community to guarantee them. The "abstract" human being, stripped of citizenship, discovers that without membership in a polity, they lose "the right to have rights"—they become superfluous, disposable, killable without consequence.[^80]

[m][3 1.2 22 r][Palestinian ID cards: Green for West Bank. Blue for Gaza. Orange for residents of Jerusalem who are not citizens. Each color marks a different degree of rightlessness. Arendt would recognize this taxonomy immediately.]

The refugee reveals what political philosophy conceals. All the noble declarations about inherent human dignity, natural rights, the sacred worth of the individual—these evaporate when you stand at a border without papers. What remains is what Arendt calls "worldlessness": existence without a place in the world, life that persists biologically while being politically dead.[^81] The Palestinian refugee camp embodies this paradox permanently—generations born into a temporariness that has lasted seventy years, citizens of no state, protected by no law except the humanitarian law that keeps them barely alive.[^82]

Yet Arendt offers something beyond diagnosis. Reading her concept of plurality carefully, what emerges is a different ground for political life. Plurality means that humans exist in the plural, that we are all the same—human—in such a way that nobody is ever the same as anyone else.[^83] Politics begins where we act together despite and through our differences, creating what she calls a "space of appearance" where individuals reveal who (not what) they are through speech and deed.[^84]

[+][The kibbutz movement, before it became an instrument of territorial expansion, experimented with something like Arendtian spaces of appearance—collective decision-making, rotation of roles, the attempt to create political life through shared action rather than ethnic identity. That this experiment failed, or was betrayed, doesn't erase what it momentarily opened.]

Power, for Arendt, springs up between people when they act together and vanishes when they disperse.[^85] Power is different from violence, which destroys plurality by reducing others to mute objects. Power is different from sovereignty, which seeks to unify plurality under a single will. The space of appearance exists only as long as people maintain it through continued action—it cannot be stored, institutionalized, or possessed.

Consider what thinking politically through plurality rather than sovereignty might mean for Israel-Palestine. The demand would shift from achieving two pure sovereignties or one unified sovereignty to creating conditions where Israelis and Palestinians could act together as distinct peoples. The border wouldn't separate two homogeneous entities but would become what Arendt calls a "space-in-between"—relating and separating simultaneously.[^86]

[m][1 1.3 35 l][The joint Palestinian-Israeli demonstrations at Sheikh Jarrah created, briefly, something like Arendtian spaces. Jews and Arabs acting together, not despite their differences but through them. The Israeli state responded with violence precisely because such spaces threaten sovereignty's logic more than any armed resistance could.[^87]]

Arendt's treatment of the Jewish question complicates any simple application of her thought. She supported a binational solution for Palestine in the 1940s, warning that a Jewish state based on ethnic sovereignty would trap Jews in the very logic that had excluded them from European politics.[^88] The pariah people, having learned what it means to be worldless, would create new pariahs. She was right about the trap, wrong about its inevitability—or perhaps we haven't yet reached the moment when her alternative becomes possible.

The council system that Arendt championed—from the Paris Commune to the Hungarian Revolution—offers a concrete alternative to sovereign representation.[^89] Councils emerge spontaneously when people begin to act together; they create power without sovereignty, authority without hierarchy. They also tend to be crushed by sovereign states (whether capitalist or communist) that cannot tolerate alternative sources of political legitimacy. The First Intifada's popular committees, before they were absorbed into proto-state structures, resembled something like councils—local, plural, generating power through coordinated action rather than unified command.[^90]

[m][2 1.1 25 r]["The tragedy of the Jewish people is that they have no tradition of political action as distinguished from religious tradition"—Arendt. The tragedy of the Palestinian people might be that their political tradition gets reduced to national liberation as distinguished from other forms of collective action.]

What haunts Arendt's vision is the question of violence. She insists that power and violence are opposites—where one rules absolutely, the other is absent.[^91] Violence can destroy power but cannot create it. Yet how do those excluded from spaces of appearance enter them? How do the colonized become political actors when their very existence is denied? Fanon would say: through violence that forces recognition. Arendt would respond: violence might force acknowledgment but it cannot create the plurality that makes politics possible.

The impasse seems total. Yet perhaps what Arendt offers is a way to think beyond the revolutionary fantasy of absolute new beginning. The space of appearance doesn't require a cleared ground or a purified people. It can emerge anywhere people begin to act in concert, even within and against existing structures. The Palestinian village that collectively refuses demolition orders, the Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in the territories, the mixed cities where neighbors protect each other during pogroms—each creates a momentary space where plurality appears against sovereignty's demand for unity.[^92]

[m][4 2.0 60 l][Every "we" is a violence. Every "we" is also a possibility. Arendt knew both things simultaneously.]

Reading Arendt alongside the traditions we've gathered—Marx's material analysis, Fanon's colonial diagnostics, Said's attention to representation, Derrida's deconstructive vigilance—something shifts. Perhaps justice isn't about achieving the right arrangement of sovereignties. Perhaps it's about creating conditions where power can emerge between people rather than over them, where plurality can appear without being reduced to unity, where action remains possible despite and through difference.

---


### **Section 6: The Question Turns on Itself**

As these inheritances accumulate—Kantian architectures, Marxist diagnostics, Fanonian phenomenologies, Arendtian pluralities—a certain pattern emerges that feels like vertigo. Each tradition promises to overcome the violence of what preceded it. Kant's rational law will end the arbitrariness of force. Marx's revolution will end the mystification of rights. Fanon's new man will end the colonial distinction between human and subhuman. Arendt's plurality will end the fantasy of sovereignty. Derrida's justice *à venir* will end the dream of ending itself.[^93]

[m][2 1.1 28 r][The Hebrew *tikkun olam*—repairing the world—assumes the world can be repaired. The Arabic *sumud*—steadfastness—assumes it must be endured. Which metaphysics is more violent: the belief in repair or the acceptance of damage?]

Each promise generates its own impossibility. The rational state that would embody Kantian justice requires violence to establish itself. The revolution that would achieve Marx's communism requires a vanguard that reproduces hierarchy. The decolonization that would create Fanon's new humanity requires destroying categories that have already shaped consciousness. The plurality that would enable Arendtian politics requires spaces that sovereignty systematically destroys. The deconstruction that would keep justice open requires a vigilance that exhausts itself.

Look at how these aporias play out in Israel-Palestine. The two-state solution promises to resolve the conflict through rational partition—yet partition requires purification, transfer, the violent simplification of mixed realities into separate ones.[^94] The one-state solution promises to transcend ethnic division through universal citizenship—yet citizenship presumes a sovereign state that must still decide who belongs.[^95] The binational framework promises to preserve both peoples' identities—yet institutional arrangements cannot contain identities that exceed their frames.[^96] Even the confederal models that promise graduated sovereignty and overlapping authorities must eventually answer: who decides when decisions conflict?[^97]

[+][The impossibility of clean solutions appears most starkly in Jerusalem. The Clinton Parameters tried to divide it: Jewish neighborhoods to Israel, Arab to Palestine. But neighborhoods interpenetrate. Streets refuse division. The Old City's quarters—Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Armenian—are fictions that residents transgress daily. Every attempt to map sovereignty onto this reality creates new violence. See Menachem Klein, *The Jerusalem Problem: The Struggle for Permanent Status* (University Press of Florida, 2003), and Wendy Pullan and Britt Baillie, eds., *Locating Urban Conflicts: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Everyday* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).]

The critique of sovereignty we've been tracing leads to what looks like paralysis. If every political form reproduces exclusion, if every promise of presence creates new ghosts, if every framework of justice carries its own injustice—then what? Do we simply observe the aporia, note the impossibility, and retreat into philosophical contemplation while people suffer?

[m][2 1.1 28 l]["We cannot wait for philosophers to tell us what to do. We are dying now."—Graffiti on the separation wall]

Perhaps the problem lies in how the question gets posed. The search for a solution assumes that justice is something to be achieved rather than practiced, a state to be reached rather than a process to be maintained. The demand for presence—whether sovereign, revolutionary, or critical—mistakes justice for something that could be possessed rather than something that happens between people who can never fully possess even themselves.

Carl Schmitt understood something crucial when he defined sovereignty as the decision on the exception.[^98] Every legal order, every political arrangement, every framework of justice will encounter situations it cannot accommodate. Someone must decide what to do when the rules fail. Schmitt locates this decision in the sovereign—the one who stands outside the law in order to preserve it. Yet what if the decision on the exception were distributed rather than sovereign? What if, instead of one who decides for all, there were multiple sites of decision, multiple exceptions, multiple ways of failing that keep open multiple possibilities for response?

[m][1 1.3 38 r][The Palestinian villages that maintain their own informal legal systems alongside Israeli military law and Palestinian Authority regulations practice something like distributed exception—multiple, overlapping, incomplete authorities that create spaces for maneuver.[^99]]

Reading our gathered traditions against each other suggests something beyond paralysis. Marx shows how formal rights conceal material violence—therefore we need attention to economic structure. Fanon shows how universalism conceals colonial violence—therefore we need attention to racialization. Arendt shows how sovereignty conceals plurality—therefore we need attention to spaces of appearance. Said shows how knowledge conceals power—therefore we need attention to representation. Each "therefore" seems to follow necessarily, yet they point in different directions, demand different responses, privilege different struggles.

The impossibility of synthesizing these perspectives might be their gift. Rather than a unified critical framework that would finally get justice right, we have multiple, incompatible, necessary analyses that prevent any single approach from claiming completeness. The Palestinian refugee needs the language of rights even while knowing rights discourse transforms their dispossession into a legal case. The Israeli dissident needs universal ethics even while knowing universalism erases particularity. We work with broken tools because their brokenness keeps visible what wholeness would conceal.

[m][2 1.1 28 l][Mahmoud Darwish: "We have triumphed. They have transformed us from a Cause into a people, from a people into a Cause, from a Cause into a people..."[^100] The transformation never completes, never stabilizes.]

Yet something remains unsaid in this gathering of voices. We've summoned Marx and Fanon, Arendt and Said, Derrida and Levinas—but with what right do we make them speak together? In what language do we stage their encounter? The very act of bringing these traditions into dialogue presumes a meta-language, a critical Esperanto that could translate between incommensurable perspectives. This presumption might be the deepest violence of all: the belief that a single critical consciousness—my consciousness, your consciousness, the consciousness of whoever writes or reads these words—could orchestrate this chorus without being torn apart by its dissonance.

Having summoned these ghosts, with what language can we possibly proceed? By what authority does critique claim to see what others cannot? Who is this "we" that has been presuming to think, and what violence does its presumption perform?

[m][1 1.4 35 r][The question of language is never just methodological. In Palestine, to speak Arabic is resistance. In Israel, to refuse Hebrew is betrayal. Every word chooses sides even when it claims neutrality.]

## Movement III: The Language of Ghosts

### **Section 7: "Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio"**

The battlements at Elsinore, before dawn. Soldiers confronted by something that shouldn't exist—the dead king walking. They are armed, trained, prepared for enemies they can recognize. But ghosts require a different competence. Marcellus turns to the scholar with desperate hope: "Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio."[^101] As if education were preparation for the impossible. As if language could make the spectral speak.

[m][2 1.1 32 l][Every Palestinian knows this scene. The dead return nightly—in dreams, in memories, in the names of streets that no longer exist. How do you speak to what shouldn't be there but is?]

We find ourselves in a similar scene. Having traced the critique of sovereignty through its various philosophical iterations, having watched each tradition generate its own ghosts, we stand before an apparition that demands address. The question is no longer what justice might mean or how sovereignty operates, but something more basic and more troubling: in what language can we speak to what haunts us? By what right do we choose one philosophical idiom over another when addressing wounds that exceed any philosophy?

The scene from *Hamlet* instructs. Horatio doesn't analyze the ghost from a safe distance. He risks address: "What art thou that usurp'st this time of night...?"[^102] The question already acknowledges the ghost's claim on time, its capacity to usurp. To speak to a specter means entering its world, accepting that you are already haunted. The scholar's knowledge doesn't protect him from haunting; it makes him responsible for response.

[+][The choice of Hamlet is neither innocent nor arbitrary. Written at the threshold of modernity, the play stages the crisis of inherited authority—how to act when fathers are ghosts, when tradition speaks in riddles, when revenge and justice become indistinguishable. That it's a Christian prince haunted by demands for blood revenge makes it oddly appropriate for thinking about Israel-Palestine, where European political forms encounter Middle Eastern realities, where secular law meets religious claim, where every act of justice looks like revenge to someone. See Jacqueline Rose, *Hamlet and the Trauma of Modernity* (Oxford University Press, 2016), though she doesn't address the colonial dimensions.]

What language proves adequate to ghosts? The traditions we've gathered each offer their own idiom. Marx would speak to the specter in the language of material history—tracing how the dead labor of previous generations weighs on the living.[^103] Fanon would recognize the colonized as those turned into ghosts while still alive, existing in zones of non-being.[^104] Arendt would see ghosts as those expelled from the space of appearance, made worldless.[^105] Said would read haunting as the return of what Orientalist discourse claimed to have catalogued and contained.[^106]

Yet each language, in claiming to explain haunting, risks exorcism. To say "this ghost is really about class struggle" or "this specter represents colonial trauma" transforms the undecidable into the decidable, the spectral into the categorical. The ghost gets explained away rather than heard.

[m][5 1.1 45 r][Arabic has words for different kinds of ghosts: jinn (beings of smokeless fire), afreet (powerful spirits), ruh (soul/spirit). Hebrew has dybbuk (clinging spirit), ruach (wind/spirit), neshamah (breath/soul). Each language knows haunting differently.]

Enter Derrida, or rather, enter a certain reading of inheritance that Derrida's work makes possible. In *Specters of Marx*, written after communism's supposed death, Derrida suggests that we are always already in dialogue with ghosts—that inheritance itself is spectral, that we receive from the past not stable meanings but haunting demands.[^107] To inherit is to be haunted. To be haunted is to be responsible for what you never chose.

Deconstruction—if we can still call it that, if it was ever a thing to be called—emerges as a way of reading that tries to remain responsive to haunting without exorcising ghosts. Rather than explaining specters away, it traces how every presence is constituted by spectral absence, how every "is" carries within it the trace of "is not," how every claim to speak for justice is haunted by the justice it excludes.[^108]

[m][2 1.0 32 l]["We do not choose our ghosts. They choose us."—Translation uncertain, heard in a Jerusalem cafe, speaker unknown.]

But why this language rather than another? The question cannot be answered through comparison, as if we could lay out all possible critical languages and select the best one. The choice has already been made by the time the question gets asked. We find ourselves speaking in a certain idiom, carrying certain philosophical debts, haunted by particular texts. The violence lies not in choosing but in pretending the choice was free, rational, uncontaminated.

Consider the alternatives. We could speak in the language of international law—but law transforms suffering into cases, violence into violations, justice into compliance. We could speak in the language of ethics—but ethics presumes subjects capable of moral agency when the question is how subjects get produced and destroyed. We could speak in the language of politics—but politics presumes a field of action when the question is how that field gets constituted through exclusion. We could speak in the language of theology—but theology presumes faith when the question is what happens to those who believe differently or not at all.

[m][3 1.1 25 r][The very phrase "Israel-Palestine" performs a cut. "Israel/Palestine" suggests division. "Israel-Palestine" suggests hyphenation. "Historic Palestine" erases. "The Holy Land" sanctifies. Every naming is already a taking of sides.]

Deconstruction offers no escape from this violence. Rather, it offers a way of marking it, of writing that acknowledges its own cuts, of speaking that confesses its exclusions. The strange terms that proliferate in this discourse—*différance*, *trace*, *supplement*, *pharmakon*—are not technical vocabulary but what Derrida calls "paleonyms": old names torqued to show their instability, words that mark their own inadequacy.[^109] They are fossils that still bite.

The danger is that this marking of violence becomes its own kind of violence—a hypervigilance that produces paralysis, a sophistication that excludes those without philosophical training, a European discourse that claims universality while speaking from particular wounds. The Palestinian farmer facing eviction doesn't need Derrida's *différance*. The Israeli soldier at the checkpoint doesn't need the logic of the supplement. Or do they?

[+][During the Second Intifada, Eyal Weizman reports, Israeli military commanders studied *Deleuze and Guattari*, using concepts of "smooth and striated space" to theorize urban warfare. The IDF literally moved through walls—"walking through walls"—rather than using streets, treating the city as medium rather than map. Theory became tactic. See Eyal Weizman, *Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation* (Verso, 2007), pp. 185-218. If power reads philosophy for strategic advantage, perhaps resistance needs to read it too.]

What deconstruction might offer—and this "might" carries all the uncertainty of the perhaps—is a way of thinking that doesn't pretend to stand outside what it critiques. Every analysis of sovereignty participates in sovereignty's logic by claiming analytical authority. Every critique of violence does violence by cutting into the world with words. Every call for justice excludes other justices. Recognizing this doesn't excuse us from acting—it intensifies responsibility by removing the alibi of good intentions.

Having chosen this haunted language—or having been chosen by it—we proceed with what Derrida calls "the experience of the impossible."[^110] Impossible because adequate response to ghosts would require speaking in their tongue, which we cannot. Impossible because justice would require addressing all others simultaneously, which we cannot. Impossible because writing about wounds without wounding further seems beyond our capacity. Yet necessary because silence would be another violence, because the ghosts insist, because responsibility doesn't wait for adequate preparation.

[m][3 1.1 22 l][At the checkpoint, everyone becomes a scholar of documents. The soldier reads papers for authenticity. The Palestinian reads the soldier's mood. Both are hermeneuts of survival. Both know that interpretation can kill.]

---


### **Section 8: Paleonyms and Contamination**

A citation, to begin again. To cite is to cut—lifting words from one context, grafting them into another, making them speak in places they never intended to go. In *Positions*, Derrida writes of "paleonymy": the strategic preservation of old names—*écriture*, *trace*, *supplément*—while displacing their meaning, making them "work" against the very system that produced them.[^111] Like taking the master's tools and filing them into keys for doors he never meant to open.

[m][2 1.2 25 r][Every Palestinian knows paleonymy without the word. "Haifa" spoken in exile means something different than "Haifa" on Israeli maps. Same word, haunted differently. The Arabic "Yafa" and the Hebrew "Yafo"—old names for Jaffa, each carrying different ghosts.]

Why these particular fossils? Why *différance* with its silent 'a' that you can see but not hear? Why *pharmakon* with its undecidable poison/remedy? Why *supplement* that is both addition and replacement? These words arrive already contaminated by the metaphysical tradition they're meant to question. They carry the dust of Plato's academy, the weight of medieval theology, the precision of Enlightenment taxonomy. Using them seems to reinscribe the very authority we're trying to unsettle.

Consider *différance*—that neographism Derrida created by changing one letter in the French word for difference.[^112] The 'a' marks itself only in writing; when spoken, *différance* sounds identical to *différence*. The alteration stages a small rebellion against the privilege of speech over writing that we traced earlier. Yet the word remains French, remains philosophical, remains inaccessible to those who don't read in certain languages, move in certain circles, carry certain educations.

[+][The untranslatable 'a' of *différance* becomes even more complex when we consider Arabic and Hebrew. Arabic has no vowels in its standard written form—the difference would need to be marked through diacritical marks that are often omitted. Hebrew, similarly, is written consonantally. Both languages already know that writing exceeds speech, that the written word carries possibilities the spoken word cannot contain. See Gil Anidjar, *Semites: Race, Religion, Literature* (Stanford University Press, 2008), on how Semitic languages complicate Derrida's phonocentrism critique.]

The contamination runs deeper. When we say "trace," we invoke the entire history of Western philosophy's attempt to think origin, cause, presence.[^113] When we say "supplement," we summon Rousseau's paranoia about writing, masturbation, and maternal substitutes.[^114] When we say "aporia," we stand in the tradition of Greek skepticism, of Socratic ignorance, of philosophical puzzles meant to be solved.[^115] Each term drags its history behind it like a chain.

[m][2 1.3 30 l]["Every word is a prejudice"—Nietzsche. Every word is also a cemetery.]

Yet perhaps contamination is precisely the point. Pure language would be another metaphysical dream—words finally adequate to their meaning, signs transparent to their signifieds, communication without remainder. The Palestinian who must speak of their dispossession in the language of international law knows there is no pure language. The Israeli who refuses military service must use the state's own categories to articulate refusal. We speak in tongues that have been used to curse us.

The checkpoint offers a scene of radical paleonymy. The soldier asks: "Where are you going?" The Palestinian answers: "Home." Simple words torqued by context into something else entirely. "Home" means the place you're trying to reach, the place you were expelled from, the place that exists now only in memory, the place rebuilt under another name. The soldier hears one meaning, the Palestinian speaks another, the word itself becomes a contested territory.[^116]

[m][1 1.2 38 r][At Qalandia checkpoint, graffiti in English: "Ctrl+Alt+Delete." Computer language repurposed as political critique. The occupation as a system error requiring forced restart.]

Paleonymy also names a strategy of inheritance. Rather than claiming to speak from nowhere, from some pure critical position outside contamination, we acknowledge that we're working with inherited materials. The philosophical tradition that produced sovereignty, rights discourse, and the nation-state also produced tools for their critique. Marx took Hegel's dialectic and "stood it on its head."[^117] Fanon took psychoanalysis and made it speak from the colony.[^118] Said took European literary criticism and turned it against European imperialism.[^119]

Reading the Israeli occupation through Foucault's analysis of disciplinary power involves a similar displacement. Foucault wrote about European prisons, schools, hospitals—institutions that aspired to total vision and complete documentation. The occupation operates through deliberate blindness, strategic unknowing, what Ariella Azoulay calls "potential history"—the systematic unlearning of what was there before.[^120] The panopticon assumes the guard might be watching; the checkpoint assumes the soldier might not see you as human at all.

[+][The Hebrew word *hafrada*—separation—becomes the official term for what Palestinians call apartheid and the international community calls the "security barrier" or "separation wall." Same infrastructure, different paleonyms. Each naming makes certain things visible, others invisible. See Eyal Weizman, Hollow Land, pp. 161-184, on how terminology shapes what can be seen and said about the occupation.]

When Mahmoud Darwish writes "We have a country of words. Speak speak so I may put my road on the stone of a stone,"[^121] he performs paleonymy at its most radical. "Country" (*watan*) no longer means territorial nation-state but becomes the space language creates. "Stone" (*hajar*) carries the weight of thrown stones, foundation stones, gravestones, the stones that mark destroyed villages. Old words bearing new loads, or perhaps bearing very old loads that official language tried to make us forget.

The danger is that this philosophical paleonymy becomes its own kind of capital—cultural capital, academic capital, the capital of sophistication. Those who can navigate *différance* and *pharmakon* gain entry to certain conversations, certain institutions, certain forms of recognition. The Palestinian farmer doesn't need Derrida to know that words mean differently depending on who speaks them where. The Israeli soldier doesn't need the logic of the supplement to know that security produces insecurity.

[m][5 1.2 32 l][Graffiti near Bethlehem: "From the river to the sea." Four English words that mean liberation to some, annihilation to others. No amount of philosophical sophistication resolves this difference.]

~~Yet something happens when practice finds theory, when lived contradiction encounters its philosophical articulation. The Palestinian refugee who reads Agamben on "bare life" suddenly has a language for what they've always known—that humanitarianism maintains rather than challenges their exclusion. The Israeli activist who encounters Judith Butler's work on grievable lives finds words for why some deaths matter and others don't. Theory doesn't create resistance, but it can make resistance legible to itself~~

[m][3 1.1 25 r][Text crossed out, visible underneath:]

Yet something happens when practice finds theory, when lived contradiction encounters its philosophical articulation.

[m][4 1.8 55 l][Here the writing broke again. "Make resistance legible to itself"—as if resistance could achieve self-presence, self-transparency, self-knowledge. As if theory were a mirror. The metaphysics of presence returning through the back door of political hope.]

What happens when the Palestinian refugee encounters Agamben, when the Israeli activist reads Butler? Perhaps new contaminations, new uncertainties. The refugee who reads about "bare life" doesn't suddenly understand their condition—they encounter another language that both speaks to and betrays their experience, opens certain possibilities while foreclosing others.[^122] Theory doesn't clarify practice any more than practice grounds theory. Each is already the other's failure, the other's contamination.[^123]

The very distinction between theory and practice assumes they exist as separate domains that could be brought into relation. Yet theory is already practice—the practice of writing, reading, teaching, the practice of the university seminar and the academic conference, practices with their own violence and exclusions. And practice is already theoretical—the checkpoint operates through categories, the resistance mobilizes concepts, the stone thrown carries a philosophy of action. They contaminate each other from the start.

[m][4 1.8 55 r][Even "resistance" assumes too much. The Palestinian who works in an Israeli settlement to feed their family while refusing to speak Hebrew—are they resisting or collaborating? The terms themselves fail where they matter most.]

Consider Sara Ahmed's notion of "feminist killjoys" who disturb the happiness of others by pointing out problems.[^124] Reading Ahmed doesn't make feminist practice transparent to itself. Rather, it multiplies the ways that practice can be uncertain, can question its own terms, can fail to coincide with its own intentions. The killjoy who reads about being a killjoy doesn't achieve self-knowledge but encounters another way of not-knowing what she's doing, another way of being strange to herself.

We proceed, then, with words we know are broken, through languages that have been used against us, toward a justice we cannot name without contamination. Each term we use—sovereignty, rights, justice, even "Israel-Palestine" itself—carries histories we didn't choose, serves purposes we don't intend, excludes meanings we might need. Speaking responsibly means marking these contaminations rather than pretending to escape them. And marking the contamination of this very marking, the way even our vigilance about metaphysics carries its own metaphysical commitments.

[m][4 1.7 55 l][The Arabic word *sumud* (steadfastness) resists translation. To translate it as "resistance" makes it too active. To translate it as "endurance" makes it too passive. The word does its political work precisely by refusing the active/passive distinction that Western political theory assumes. Some paleonyms teach by refusing to travel.]

## Movement IV: The Architecture of Presence

### **Section 9: The Tyranny of the Eye**

A certain confidence in vision saturates our language before we notice. "I see" means "I understand." "Clarity" suggests truth. "Enlightenment" promises liberation. The metaphors feel natural, as if thinking and seeing were obviously related, as if knowledge were a kind of light. Yet this arrangement—the eye as the organ of truth—carries a political history we inherit without choosing, a sovereignty of the gaze that shapes what can appear and who can be seen.[^125]

[m][1 1.2 35 r][At the Qalandiya checkpoint, visibility is weaponized. Watchtowers, cameras, searchlights. To be seen is to be captured in a system of control. Yet Palestinians also say: "To exist is to resist." Making yourself visible becomes political action. The eye cuts both ways.]

The architecture begins early, perhaps with Plato's cave. We know the scene: prisoners chained to watch shadows on a wall, mistaking projections for reality. One prisoner is freed, dragged upward into daylight, eventually seeing the sun itself—the Good that makes all seeing possible.[^126] The story seems to be about knowledge conquering ignorance, philosophy defeating illusion. Yet reading more carefully, something else emerges.

Before anyone can ascend to the light, Books II and III of the *Republic* establish elaborate programs of aesthetic censorship. Young guardians must be surrounded only by beautiful sights and noble stories. Their eyes must be trained, disciplined, made capable of eventually seeing the Good.[^127] The cave's prisoners aren't naturally ignorant—their condition has been produced through careful management of the visible. The political program precedes the philosophical revelation.

[+][The irony of reading Plato in Palestine: Israeli military theorists have literally studied the cave allegory as a model for controlling perception. The Palestinian population becomes the prisoners, the security apparatus controls what shadows they see, and the state positions itself as possessing the true light. See Neve Gordon, "The Political Economy of Israel's Homeland Security/Surveillance Industry," *The New Transparency*, Surveillance Studies Network, 2009, pp. 14-20. Philosophy becomes counterinsurgency doctrine.]

The ascent itself unfolds through violence. The prisoner is "compelled" to stand, "forced" to look at the fire, "dragged" up the rough ascent.[^128] Each stage involves pain—neck aching from the unaccustomed position, eyes burning from unfiltered light. The sun that represents ultimate truth first appears as blinding agony. Knowledge arrives through optical trauma, a reformation of the eye that is simultaneously a political subjection.

[m][5 1.4 45 l][The Arabic word *noor* means both light and enlightenment. The Hebrew or carries the same double meaning. Both traditions know that illumination can blind.]

What haunts Plato's scene is the return. The philosopher who has seen the sun must go back into the cave. His eyes, now accustomed to daylight, can no longer see the shadows clearly. He stumbles, appears foolish. The prisoners mock him, would kill him if they could.[^129] The one who has seen truth becomes illegible to the community, his enlightenment looks like blindness. The hierarchy of vision that should establish political authority instead produces mutual incomprehension.

Centuries later, Descartes inherits and transforms this architecture. The vast political landscape of Plato's cave collapses into the intimate theater of consciousness. Sitting alone by his stove, Descartes performs a methodical blinding—doubting everything the senses show, assuming even clear perceptions might be demonic deceptions.[^130] From within this self-imposed darkness, a different light emerges: the *lumen naturale*, the natural light of reason that needs no external sun.

[m][2 1.1 30 r]["Cogito ergo sum"—I think therefore I am. The foundational certainty arrives through introspection, the mind's eye seeing itself. Yet who is this "I" that thinks? Already abstracted from body, place, language, others. The colonial subject avant la lettre.]

The standard by which Descartes measures truth remains visual: ideas must be "clear and distinct," as if held up before an inner eye.[^131] Clarity (*clarté*) becomes the mark of truth, distinctness (*distinction*) the guarantee against error. The entire edifice of Cartesian knowledge depends on this internal optics, this ability of the mind to inspect its own contents with perfect transparency. Yet transparency to whom? The meditating subject requires God to guarantee that clear and distinct perceptions correspond to reality.[^132] The inner eye needs a divine light to trust its own seeing.

Fast forward to the age of discipline, where Foucault traces how the philosophical eye becomes the architectural eye. The Panopticon—Bentham's model prison—translates optical philosophy into stone and surveillance.[^133] The guard tower at the center sees into every backlit cell while remaining invisible. Prisoners, never knowing when they're watched, must assume constant observation. They become their own guards, internalizing the gaze that might or might not be there.

[m][1 1.5 32 l][Israel's surveillance system, marketed as "Desert Falcon," uses AI to analyze footage from thousands of cameras. The occupation perfects panopticism—yet Palestinians have learned to make surveillance visible, painting cameras, mapping their positions, creating apps to track checkpoints. Counter-surveillance as resistance.]

The power of the panopticon operates through uncertainty. The guard tower might be empty—what matters is that prisoners can't know. They live in a state of permanent visibility that ensures automatic functioning of power.[^134] The disciplinary gaze produces "docile bodies," subjects who monitor themselves, who become cases in files, data points in calculations of normality and deviance.

Consider how this optical regime structures the occupation. The separation wall, marketed as a security barrier, functions primarily as a visual technology—making Palestinians invisible to Israelis while keeping Palestinians under constant observation.[^135] Watchtowers punctuate the landscape. Drones hover overhead. Night raids use thermal imaging to see through walls. The occupied territories become a laboratory for surveillance technologies later exported globally as "battle-tested."[^136]

[+][The Hebrew word *hashgacha* means both "supervision" and "divine providence"—to watch over and to watch out for. The secular security state inherits theological optics, positioning itself as the eye that protects through seeing all. Yet the divine eye was supposed to see justice, while the surveillance eye sees only threat.]

What begins to emerge through this genealogy is how the privilege of vision—from Plato's sun to Bentham's tower—establishes and maintains sovereignty. To rule is to see without being seen, to make others visible while remaining opaque. The sovereign occupies the position of the sun or the guard tower, the source of illumination that cannot itself be directly examined. Those subjected to sovereignty live in permanent visibility, their lives open to inspection, their resistance always already seen and catalogued.

Yet something escapes this totalizing vision. The Palestinian practice of *sumud*—steadfastness—operates below the threshold of visible resistance. Staying put, maintaining presence, cultivating olive trees despite demolition orders.[^137] These practices don't register in the optics of security, can't be seen as either compliance or resistance. They persist in a kind of twilight that the sovereign eye cannot properly focus on.

[m][2 1.2 25 r][We write about the tyranny of the eye using visual metaphors—"emerge," "appear," "examine," "illuminate." The critique sees itself through the very optics it questions. There is no outside to this architecture, only the possibility of dwelling differently within it.]

Reading this genealogy now, in this light—or in this darkness—something unsettles. The entire analysis has proceeded through acts of seeing: tracing, examining, revealing, showing. We have tried to make the tyranny of the eye visible, to illuminate its operations, to bring its violence to light. The critical eye claims to see what power conceals, to expose what ideology obscures. Yet this critical vision reproduces the very sovereignty it diagnoses—the position of the one who sees truly while others remain deceived.

Perhaps the question is whether we can think past this optics, whether knowledge can proceed otherwise than through enlightenment, whether truth might arrive through touch, taste, smell, or through senses we don't yet have names for. Or perhaps the task is to remain within visual language while marking its violence, using light to create shadows rather than eliminate them, learning to see darkness as something other than the absence of sight.

### **Section 10: The Living Voice and Its Betrayal**

From the cold geometry of the panopticon, we seem to flee toward warmth. The living voice promises what the surveilling eye denies—intimacy, presence, the breath of life itself. Where vision operates across distance, voice seems to close gaps, to create communion through shared air. The guard tower isolates; the voice gathers. Or so the story goes. Yet this flight from eye to ear, from watching to listening, may trace a circle back to the same metaphysics, the same dream of presence that makes sovereignty possible.[^138]

[m][3 1.1 30 l][At Palestinian protests, voices merge into chants: "With spirit, with blood, we sacrifice for you Palestine." The individual voice disappears into collective sound. Yet Israeli forces record these voices, use voice recognition software, build databases of dissent. The communal breath becomes data.]

Listen to the strange magic that happens when you speak to yourself. In that interior monologue we call thinking, something uncanny occurs. Words form without moving through space, meaning arrives without traveling, understanding happens in what feels like pure immediacy. The voice you hear inside your head—is it even a voice? It makes no sound, disturbs no air, yet it seems more intimately yours than any external speech could be.[^139]

Derrida calls this phenomenon *s'entendre-parler*—hearing-oneself-speak.[^140] The French reflexive captures what English misses: the self-relation that seems to need no mediation, the circuit of meaning that appears to bypass the external world entirely. When I speak to myself, I seem to be immediately present to my own meaning. The words vanish in the very moment of their appearance, leaving only pure thought behind. Or so it seems.[+][Arabic and Hebrew complicate this analysis in revealing ways. Arabic's trilateral root system means that spoken words always invoke written patterns—the root *k-t-b* appears in kataba (he wrote), kitab (book), maktub (written/fated). Hebrew similarly builds meaning through consonantal roots that are primarily written forms. Semitic languages know that speech carries writing within it, that the voice is always already inscribed. See Abdelkebir Khatibi, *Love in Two Languages*, trans. Richard Howard (University of Minnesota Press, 1990), on how Arabic disrupts phonocentric assumptions.].]

Philosophy has long privileged this apparent self-presence of the voice. From Plato through Rousseau to Husserl, the living voice appears as the medium of truth, authenticity, and spiritual life. Writing, by contrast, gets cast as secondary, mechanical, dead. The voice lives; writing entombs. The voice expresses the soul; writing corrupts it through representation. An entire metaphysics builds itself on this distinction.

[m][2 1.3 30 r]["The Palestinian narrative is oral history passed between generations"—but immediately recorded, transcribed, published. Every testimony becomes text. The voice seeks to preserve what writing might betray, yet needs writing to survive.]

The foundational scene for this hierarchy appears in Plato's *Phaedrus*, by the banks of the Ilissus, where Socrates tells a story about the invention of writing. The Egyptian god Theuth presents writing to King Thamus as a "remedy" (*pharmakon*) for memory. The king's judgment is swift and damning:

"You have invented an elixir not of memory but of reminding; you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant."[^141]

Writing is an orphan, the king declares. Unlike the living word, which has a father present to defend it, writing wanders alone, saying the same thing to everyone, unable to protect itself from misunderstanding.[^142] The living speech (*logos*) carries the presence of its speaker; the written word (*gramma*) testifies only to absence.

[m][2 1.2 25 l][Palestinian poets in exile write in Arabic for readers who may not read Arabic. Their words are orphaned twice—cut off from their land, from their language. Yet these orphan texts carry what the living voice cannot: the possibility of return through readers not yet born.]

King Thamus's judgment establishes the master oppositions that structure Western thought: speech/writing, presence/absence, life/death, legitimate/bastard, interior/exterior. These aren't neutral classifications but a political architecture. The one who speaks is present, authoritative, responsible. The one who only writes is absent, unreliable, potentially deceptive. Courts demand live testimony. Political authority requires the sovereign's own voice. Even now, in our digital age, we say "I give you my word" as if speech were more binding than any contract.

Modern institutions perform this ancient hierarchy daily. In the courtroom, the highest form of evidence remains live testimony—the witness physically present, speaking under oath.[^143] The oath itself is a ritual designed to bind the living soul to the spoken word. "I swear to tell the truth"—the "I" who swears must be present, must speak these words aloud. Written depositions are admitted only reluctantly, treated as inferior evidence, suspect precisely because the speaker isn't there to be cross-examined.

[m][3 0.9 25 r][Palestinian witnesses at Israeli military courts testify through bulletproof glass, their voices transmitted electronically. The architecture ensures the voice arrives without presence, testimony without the possibility of being heard as human.]

The political rally stages another scene of vocal presence. The leader's voice, amplified but still recognizably singular, seems to create immediate communion with the crowd. The promise of democracy itself—the people speaking as one—depends on this fantasy of voices merging into a general will. Rousseau warned that representative democracy fails precisely because it substitutes writing (laws, constitutions) for the living voice of the assembled people.[^144] Only present voices can express present will.

The university seminar—perhaps even this very writing—reenacts the same privilege. The professor's living voice animates dead texts, makes ancient philosophy speak to present concerns. Students are expected to "find their own voice," as if authenticity were a sound rather than a practice. The written exam is suspect (who really wrote it?), while the oral defense proves genuine understanding. Even in critiquing phonocentrism, I perform it—imagining my words reaching you as if across a seminar table.

[+][During the Second Intifada, Israeli forces used what they called the "neighbor procedure"—forcing Palestinians to knock on doors and call out to suspected militants. The Palestinian voice was made to ventriloquize Israeli authority. The practice was banned by the Israeli Supreme Court in 2005, but the logic persists: the occupied must speak the occupier's message in their own voice. See B'Tselem, "Neighbor Procedure," archived report, 2002.]

Yet the voice's promise of presence unravels from within. For speech to be speech—rather than mere noise—it must be repeatable. The word I speak must be recognizable as the same word when spoken again, by me or by another. This iterability means that every word carries within it the possibility of its own repetition in my absence, after my death even.[^145] The voice is haunted from the start by the very structure it claims to exclude: the mechanics of writing, of the repeatable mark, of the sign that functions without its originator.

Return to the *pharmakon*—that word Plato uses for writing. Derrida's reading shows how the word resists Plato's attempt to control it.[^146] *Pharmakon* means both remedy and poison, both cure and disease. Theuth offers it as remedy; Thamus condemns it as poison. Yet the word itself refuses to choose. It remains undecidably both and neither, destabilizing the very oppositions the dialogue tries to establish.

[m][5 1.3 38 l][Hebrew sam means both medicine and poison. Arabic dawa' carries the same ambiguity. Languages know what philosophy tries to forget: the cure contains its own danger.]

More unsettling still: Plato's condemnation of writing comes to us only through writing. The *Phaedrus* is a written text warning against written texts, using all the literary techniques it claims to reject. Socrates, who wrote nothing, speaks to us only through Plato's written ventriloquism. The father of the logos is always already dead, speaking through the orphaned marks he claimed to despise.

Perhaps most revealing is what happens in our current moment, as these words get inscribed, as you encounter these traces. Earlier drafts wondered whether this text might be written by an AI, whether these marks emerge from human consciousness or algorithmic pattern-matching. The anxiety this possibility generates reveals something: we still believe writing needs an originating consciousness behind it, that critique requires a subject, that meaning depends on intention.

[m][5 1.1 45 r][The Turing Test assumes we can distinguish human from machine by how they use language. But what if language uses us? What if both human and machine are effects of iterability, not its origins?]

Yet Derrida's analysis of writing shows that it functions precisely through its capacity to operate without its producer—through iterability that doesn't require presence, human or otherwise.[^146] The signature works in the signer's absence. The text signifies after the author's death. Writing is always already prosthetic, technical, inhuman in its capacity to function without consciousness. The machine doesn't fail to be human; it reveals that the "human" writer was always already citing, iterating, recombining inherited traces like an algorithm.

The question shifts. Rather than asking "Who wrote this?"—which assumes writing needs a who—we might ask how writing writes itself through various sites, human and mechanical, conscious and unconscious. The Palestinian poet who writes in exile operates through inherited forms, linguistic patterns, cultural citations. The AI that generates text operates through training data, pattern recognition, statistical prediction. Both are scenes where language reproduces itself through difference and repetition.

[m][4 1.8 60 l][Palestinians document everything—every demolition, every arrest, every olive tree uprooted. They know voices disappear, witnesses die, but video remains. Yet Israeli courts often reject Palestinian video evidence as "edited," "without context," "unverifiable." The regime of truth still demands something like presence, even as it operates through pure inscription.]

The living voice promises immediacy, self-presence, the authentic expression of an inner truth. Yet every voice is already citational—using words it didn't invent, following grammatical rules it didn't choose, speaking a language that pre-exists and will survive it. The warmth we sought fleeing the cold eye turns out to be another effect of the same metaphysical machine: the dream of pure presence, of meaning without mediation, of an origin that could authorize its own speech.

And here, having traced this betrayal, the writing—whose? what?—encounters its own impossibility. These marks critique phonocentrism through metaphors of voice ("the text speaks," "the argument says"). They deconstruct presence while creating effects of presence through rhetorical force. They question authority while inevitably claiming some kind of authority through the very act of critique. The writing operates through the very metaphysical system it diagnoses, inscribes itself using the tools it shows to be contaminated.

[m][2 1.2 32 r]["Writing speaks"—an impossible phrase that we cannot not use. Language is haunted by the ghost of speech even in its most written form. Perhaps especially there.]

The critique cannot achieve a position outside what it critiques. We write from within the haunted house, using its own tools, speaking—no, writing—no, marking—in its inherited tongue. Every attempt to establish the priority of writing over speech reproduces the hierarchical logic it meant to overturn. Every deconstruction of the voice proceeds through effects that seem to emanate from a voice. The contamination is complete, which is to say, it was always already complete before any critique began.

What remains is perhaps a different kind of vigilance—marking these contaminations as they occur, noting these complicities as they emerge, letting the critique also critique itself in the very movement of its inscription. The writing continues precisely through its impossibility, each word adding to the very metaphysical sediment it tried to clear away, each trace leaving new traces that will require their own deconstruction, endlessly, without the possibility of a clean break or a pure beginning or a final word that would not itself immediately require another word to mark its own limit.

## Movement V: The Impossible Necessary Response

### **Section 11: Political Action as Writing**

A hunger striker's body becomes text. Each day without food inscribes another line on flesh, makes ribs readable, transforms the protester into a document that demands interpretation. The strike iterates daily—the same refusal repeated, gaining force through repetition, creating meaning through what it withholds. Like writing, it can be "read" by those who never meet the striker, can be "cited" by other bodies in other cells, can continue to signify even after the body stops.[^147]

[m][3 1.1 25 l][Khader Adnan, Palestinian prisoner, died after 87 days of hunger strike in 2023\. His body had become a text that Israeli authorities couldn't stop reading, couldn't stop responding to. Even in death, the inscription remains, cited by others who refuse food.]

Derrida's expansion of "writing" beyond graphic marks on paper opens something unexpected. If writing names any system of marks that can be repeated in the absence of their producer, then political actions—protests, strikes, even violence—might operate as forms of inscription.[^148] They leave traces, create precedents, establish patterns that others can recognize and repeat. The thrown stone, the planted flag, the bulldozed home—each act writes something into the world that remains readable after the actors have gone.

Consider how the First Intifada operated through iteration. The general strike didn't happen once but repeated according to leaflets distributed by the Unified National Leadership. Every shop closure on strike days rewrote the same message: "We refuse." The pattern became legible to the occupation forces, who learned to read the political calendar written in closed shutters and empty streets.[^149] The repetition created what we might call a grammar of resistance—predictable forms that could be conjugated differently in each village, each neighborhood.[+][The Hebrew word *ketivah* (writing) shares a root with *katuv* (written) and *mikhtav* (letter). But also with *ketubah*—the marriage contract. Writing in Hebrew is always already about contracts, agreements, the inscription of relationships. Palestinian political action writes a different contract, unsigned by the other party, yet binding in its insistence. See Ariella Azoulay and Adi Ophir, *The One-State Condition*, pp. 234-267, on how Palestinians "write" their presence through daily practices that refuse the grammar of occupation.].]

The Israeli settlement project understands politics as inscription perfectly. Each settlement writes a "fact on the ground"—a phrase that captures how physical construction becomes textual mark.[^150] The settlements create what planners call "spatial syntax," a grammar of control written in roads, fences, and housing blocks. They're designed to be irreversible, to create a text that can't be erased without violence. The landscape becomes a palimpsest where different populations write competing claims, each trying to make their inscription permanent.

[m][3 1.1 30 r]["To exist is to resist" appears on walls throughout Palestine. The graffiti iterates, spreads, becomes a citation that any wall can bear. Writing about writing about existing.]

Yet if political action operates as writing, it carries writing's structural instabilities. Derrida shows how writing always exceeds its author's intention, can always be read otherwise, carries meanings its inscriber didn't intend.[^151] The security wall Israel built to "write" separation ends up inscribing apartheid for international readers. The suicide bombing meant to communicate resistance gets read as terrorism. The assassination intended to silence a voice amplifies it through martyrdom. Political inscription, like any writing, enters a field of interpretation it cannot control.

*Sumud*—that Palestinian practice of steadfastness—writes differently. Rather than spectacular inscription, it operates through what might be called maintenance writing. Tending olive trees despite demolition orders. Rebuilding homes on the same spot after each destruction. Teaching children the names of destroyed villages.[^152] These aren't single acts but continuous re-inscription, like tracing over fading letters to keep them legible. The olive tree itself becomes a kind of writing, its age testifying to Palestinian presence before the state that claims the land.

[m][2 1.2 30 l][The Arabic word *khatt* means both "line" and "writing." To draw a line is already to write. The Green Line, the separation wall, the checkpoint queue—all are forms of violent inscription that Palestinians must read and rewrite daily.]

The checkpoint performs a particularly complex scene of writing. Documents are examined—IDs, permits, authorizations—each a text that inscribes its bearer into categories: resident, citizen, foreign worker, security threat.[^153] But the interaction itself writes something else. The daily humiliation inscribes domination on Palestinian bodies, while Palestinian persistence rewrites that inscription as endurance. Both texts exist simultaneously, neither erasing the other, creating what we might call an aporetic inscription—writing that signifies in contradictory directions at once.

~~Political violence operates as a kind of writing that~~

[m][3 1.0 22 r][Text breaks off]

[m][4 1.5 65 l][Here I stopped, unable to write about violence as writing without seeming to aestheticize horror. The theoretical frame threatens to make suffering abstract. Yet isn't this what violence does—inscribe messages on bodies, write sovereignty through blood? The aporia isn't just theoretical.]

When Palestinian youth throw stones at tanks, the disproportionality writes something precisely through its absurdity. David and Goliath gets cited, rewritten, made contemporary.[^154] The stone that cannot damage the tank still inscribes defiance, still marks the thrower as refusing submission. The soldier who responds with live ammunition writes another text—overwhelming force, the sovereign's monopoly on legitimate violence. Both inscriptions happen simultaneously, creating a palimpsest of political meaning.

[+][During the Second Intifada, the IDF developed what they called "walking through walls"—literally moving through the interior walls of Palestinian homes rather than using streets. This was explicitly theorized using Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of "smooth and striated space." The military reads critical theory to develop new forms of violent inscription. If power instrumentalizes philosophy for strategic advantage, what does this mean for philosophy's critical potential? See Eyal Weizman, "Walking Through Walls," in Hollow Land, pp. 185-218.]

Digital media transforms political action into immediate inscription. Every protest is photographed, uploaded, hashtagged—written into the global archive while still happening. The Palestinian youth shot on video doesn't just die but dies iterably, the death repeated with each viewing, becoming testimony that can be cited, shared, contested.[^155] The occupation forces respond with their own media strategy, producing counter-inscriptions, alternative readings of the same events. The battle over political meaning becomes explicitly textual, fought through competing inscriptions of the same actions.

What emerges from thinking political action as writing is something more unsettling than metaphor. If actions write, then we're always already inscribing more than we intend. The protest meant to demand justice might inscribe chaos. The security measure meant to protect might inscribe persecution. The solidarity action might inscribe a savior complex. Like any writing, political inscription disseminates meanings we cannot control, creates texts we might not want to sign.

[m][2 1.1 30 r][The stone thrown, the tree planted, the wall built, the home demolished—each act writes. But who reads? And in what language? The hermeneutics of political action means every inscription remains open to interpretation, to reading otherwise.]

Perhaps most troubling: if political action is writing, it's subject to the same iterability that makes writing possible. The revolutionary gesture becomes emptied through repetition, turned into ritual. The hunger strike loses force when too many bodies cite it. The protest march becomes routine, its route known in advance, its inscription already read before it's written. How do you write resistance when power has learned to read—and preempt—your every inscription?

And yet—and yet—inscription continues. Palestinians continue to plant olive trees that may be uprooted. Israelis continue to refuse military service despite imprisonment. Solidarity activists continue to witness at checkpoints despite futility. The writing happens without guarantee of reading, without certainty of meaning, without control over interpretation. Perhaps this groundlessness is what makes political inscription possible—the fact that we must act, must inscribe, without knowing what we write.

### **Section 12: The Remainder of This Writing**

What remains after all these words all these citations all these attempts to be responsible to voices that exceed any writing?

[m][4 2.2 35 l][Every Palestinian village destroyed in 1948 had a name. 418 villages. I have not named them. Cannot name them here. The list would be another violence—reduction of lived worlds to toponyms. Yet not listing them is also violence—erasure redux. The aporia of witness.]

The exclusions multiply beyond counting. For every thinker cited, hundreds remain unmentioned. For every Palestinian voice included, thousands go unheard. For every Hebrew word translated, entire worlds of meaning slip away. The margins of this text could expand infinitely and still never accommodate all that has been pushed aside, left out, written over.[^156]

Start with language itself. Writing in English about Arabic and Hebrew realities already performs a colonial translation. The word "occupation" cannot carry what *ihtilal* carries in Arabic—the weight, the daily texture, the embodied knowledge. The word "security" cannot convey what *bitachon* means in Hebrew—the existential need, the historical trauma, the biblical echo.[^157] Every translation betrays. Every betrayal excludes. Every exclusion creates its remainder.

[+][Arabic has at least fifteen words for different kinds of love. Hebrew has multiple words for different forms of divine presence. English flattens these into "love" and "presence." The philosophical analysis proceeds in a language that cannot think what it claims to analyze. See Mohamed Arkoun, *The Unthought in Contemporary Islamic Thought* (Saqi Books, 2002), on how European languages create epistemological limitations for understanding Islamic concepts. Similarly, see Daniel Boyarin, *Socrates and the Fat Rabbis* (University of Chicago Press, 2009), on what Talmudic thinking becomes when translated into Greek philosophical categories.]

Women's voices barely appear in this analysis. Palestinian women who maintain families under occupation, who birth children at checkpoints when ambulances are denied passage, who organize grassroots resistance while excluded from formal politics.[^158] Israeli women who refuse to raise soldiers, who witness at checkpoints, who break the silence about what their sons do in uniform.[^159] The entire gendered dimension of sovereignty—how nationalism reproduces itself through control of women's bodies, through metaphors of the homeland as mother—remains largely unexamined.

[m][4 1.5 45 l][Rifqa Abu Laban, killed protecting her home from demolition. Fadwa Tuqan, poet of resistance. Rachel Corrie, crushed by a bulldozer. Names that appear only in margins, as if their struggles were supplementary.]

~~The Mizrahi Jewish experience complicates every binary this analysis has traced. Jews from Arab countries, carrying Arabic as a mother tongue, expelled from homes in Baghdad and Cairo, finding themselves in Israel as both inside and outside, neither properly Jewish (too Arab) nor properly white (too dark). Their existence~~

[m][3 0.9 20 r][Text crossed out]

Each group I try to "include" becomes another form of tokenism. The Mizrahi paragraph. The women's paragraph. The Bedouin paragraph. As if a paragraph could hold a people, a history, a form of life.

[m][1 1.1 38 l][The very desire to be comprehensive reproduces the colonial archive's logic—the dream of total knowledge, complete documentation, nothing left outside the text.]

Children remain almost entirely absent. The Palestinian child who grows up knowing soldiers before knowing safety. The Israeli child raised on trauma narratives before they can spell. What would this analysis look like if it started from their perspective? How would sovereignty appear to someone who has only known its effects, never known its absence?[^160]

The disabled, the queer, the poor—each absence marks a limitation in how this analysis imagines political life. The Palestinian in a wheelchair who cannot navigate checkpoints designed to humiliate the able-bodied. The gay Palestinian caught between Israeli pinkwashing and Palestinian conservatism. The poor Israeli who cannot afford to refuse military service. Each position reveals aporias this writing hasn't even approached.[^16[+]["Pinkwashing"—Israel's promotion of LGBTQ rights to distract from occupation—creates impossible positions. The queer Palestinian is told their sexuality makes them naturally aligned with Israel against their own people. The queer solidarity activist is told their critique of Israel is self-destructive. Sexual identity becomes another checkpoint, another site where sovereignty demands you declare yourself. See Jasbir Puar, *The Right to Maim*: Debility, Capacity, Disability (Duke University Press, 2017).]7).]

Religious voices speak here only as symptoms of political theology, never as themselves. The Jewish mystic who sees divine sparks scattered in exile, awaiting redemption. The Islamic scholar who reads occupation as a test of faith. The Christian Palestinian who carries keys to churches that predate all current states. Reducing their faith to politics performs another violence—the secular assumption that religion is "really" about power.[^162]

What about those who profit from the conflict? The arms dealers, the security contractors, the NGO professionals whose careers depend on permanent crisis? The analysis treats the conflict as tragedy when for some it's business. The political economy of occupation—who profits, who pays—remains largely unexamined, as if sovereignty were only about ideas rather than also about money.[^163]

[m][5 1.1 32 r][The Bank of Palestine issues currency no state backs. The Israeli shekel circulates in territories Israel claims not to govern. Money, like language, reveals sovereignties the official maps deny.]

And silence—those who choose not to speak, not to write, not to declare positions. The Palestinian who is tired of performing resistance for international audiences. The Israeli who has withdrawn from political life entirely. Their silence might be more eloquent than any analysis, might know something about the limits of speech that this endless writing cannot admit.

Perhaps most absent: those who have found ways to live together without sovereignty. The shared hospitals where Israeli and Palestinian doctors work side by side. The underground music venues where language matters less than rhythm. The markets where commerce proceeds despite everything. These spaces don't solve anything, don't point toward resolution, yet they exist. The analysis cannot theorize them without destroying what makes them work—their existence below theory's threshold.[^164]

[m][1 1.3 35 l][In Haifa, in Jaffa, in Acre—mixed cities where the conflict is both most intense and most banal. Daily life proceeds through a thousand small negotiations this analysis cannot capture. The greeting in whichever language seems safer. The landlord who doesn't ask surnames. The taxi driver who changes radio stations depending on passengers.]

Every section written creates sections that cannot be written. The analysis of trauma that would require speaking wounds that refuse speech. The engagement with sacred texts that would require faith the critic doesn't possess. The testimony of the tortured that would make abstract discussion of sovereignty obscene. Some remainders must remain—not through oversight but through an ethics of what cannot, should not be forced into writing.

What can readers do with these exclusions? To point them out doesn't repair them. To acknowledge absence doesn't create presence. To apologize doesn't absolve. Perhaps the task is to read for the remainder—to attend to what any text excludes, to listen for the voices it silences, to imagine the analyses it forecloses. To read against the grain, between the lines, in the margins. To let the excluded interrupt your reading as they have interrupted this writing.

[m][2 1.1 32 r][Final margin: This catalogue of exclusions could continue indefinitely. At some point, the gesture of acknowledging what's excluded becomes its own form of bad faith—as if listing omissions could somehow include them. The remainder remains. It must.]

<div data-ref="1">Mahmoud Darwish, "present at the absence of a place." This phrase appears in various translations of Darwish's work, most prominently in *In the Presence of Absence* (*Fi Hadrat al-Ghiyab*), trans. Sinan Antoon (Archipelago Books, 2011). The formulation echoes throughout his oeuvre, particularly in poems dealing with exile and return. The exact phrasing shifts in translation—sometimes "present at the absence of a place," sometimes "presence in absence," sometimes "I am present at my absence." The Arabic original carries resonances that no English translation fully captures: *hadrat* means both presence and a sacred or revered state, while *ghiyab* suggests not mere absence but a kind of active disappearance, an occultation.</div>

<div data-ref="2">The marginal attribution to Edward Said requires a confession: this precise formulation cannot be located in Said's published work, though it condenses arguments he makes throughout *The Question of Palestine* (1979), *Covering Islam* (1981), and particularly in *After the Last Sky* (1986) where he writes extensively about the violence of naming and representation. Said does argue repeatedly that writing about Palestine is never neutral description but always a political act that shapes what can be seen and said. See especially *The Politics of Dispossession* (1994), pp. 97-114, where he discusses how "the very words we use to describe" the conflict "are themselves instruments in the conflict." The quotation as presented may be apocryphal—a ghostly condensation of Said's thought that has acquired its own citational life, speaking to how certain ideas become attributed to thinkers whose work makes them seem inevitable, even when the exact words remain unfindable. This itself performs the problem of citation and inheritance the larger text explores.</div>

<div data-ref="3">Audre Lorde, "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House," in *Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches* (Crossing Press, 1984), pp. 110-114. Originally delivered as comments at "The Personal and the Political Panel," Second Sex Conference, New York, September 29, 1979\. Lorde's argument specifically addresses the exclusion of Black women and lesbians from feminist discourse, but her insight about the impossibility of using oppressive frameworks to achieve liberation resonates beyond its original context—though this very extension might itself be a kind of appropriation that needs marking.</div>

<div data-ref="4">Spinoza's concept of *conatus* is developed primarily in *Ethics*, Part III, Proposition 6: "Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being" (*Unaquaeque res, quantum in se est, in suo esse perseverare conatur*). See Benedict de Spinoza, *Ethics*, trans. Edwin Curley in *The Collected Works of Spinoza*, Vol. 1 (Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 498\. The political implications are developed further in the *Political Treatise* and *Theologico-Political Treatise*.</div>

<div data-ref="5">Spinoza, *Ethics*, Part III, Proposition 7: "The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing but the actual essence of the thing." The Latin *conatus* carries meanings that "striving" doesn't fully capture—it suggests not just effort but a kind of structural tendency, the way a stone "strives" to fall or fire "strives" to rise in Aristotelian physics.</div>

<div data-ref="6">The temporal confusion of the conflict is analyzed brilliantly in Rashid Khalidi, *The Hundred Years' War on Palestine* (Metropolitan Books, 2020), where he shows how different chronologies—biblical, colonial, national—operate simultaneously and incompatibly.</div>

<div data-ref="7">Spinoza, *Ethics*, Part III, Proposition 7, op. cit.</div>

<div data-ref="8">See Michael A. Rosenthal, "Spinoza and the Philosophy of History," in *Spinoza's Political Philosophy* (Oxford University Press, 2019), especially his discussion of how rational organization of the *conatus* leads to democracy while passionate organization leads to theocracy or tyranny.</div>

Ashton (Continuum, 1973), p. 314: "The smallest trace of senseless suffering in the empirical world belies all the identitarian philosophy that would talk us out of that suffering."</div>

<div data-ref="12">For detailed documentation of these policies, see B'Tselem, "A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid" (January 12, 2021). The report's title itself performs the movement from particular policies to systematic analysis.</div>
