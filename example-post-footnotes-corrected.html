<div data-ref="1">Mahmoud Darwish, "present at the absence of a place." This phrase appears in various translations of Darwish's work, most prominently in <em>In the Presence of Absence</em> (<em>Fi Hadrat al-Ghiyab</em>), trans. Sinan Antoon (Archipelago Books, 2011). The formulation echoes throughout his oeuvre, particularly in poems dealing with exile and return. The exact phrasing shifts in translation—sometimes "present at the absence of a place," sometimes "presence in absence," sometimes "I am present at my absence." The Arabic original carries resonances that no English translation fully captures: <em>hadrat</em> means both presence and a sacred or revered state, while <em>ghiyab</em> suggests not mere absence but a kind of active disappearance, an occultation.</div>

<div data-ref="2" data-extension="true">The marginal attribution to Edward Said requires a confession: this precise formulation cannot be located in Said's published work, though it condenses arguments he makes throughout <em>The Question of Palestine</em> (1979), <em>Covering Islam</em> (1981), and particularly in <em>After the Last Sky</em> (1986) where he writes extensively about the violence of naming and representation. Said does argue repeatedly that writing about Palestine is never neutral description but always a political act that shapes what can be seen and said. See especially <em>The Politics of Dispossession</em> (1994), pp. 97-114, where he discusses how "the very words we use to describe" the conflict "are themselves instruments in the conflict." The quotation as presented may be apocryphal—a ghostly condensation of Said's thought that has acquired its own citational life, speaking to how certain ideas become attributed to thinkers whose work makes them seem inevitable, even when the exact words remain unfindable. This itself performs the problem of citation and inheritance the larger text explores.</div>

<div data-ref="3">Audre Lorde, "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House," in <em>Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches</em> (Crossing Press, 1984), pp. 110-114. Originally delivered as comments at "The Personal and the Political Panel," Second Sex Conference, New York, September 29, 1979. Lorde's argument specifically addresses the exclusion of Black women and lesbians from feminist discourse, but her insight about the impossibility of using oppressive frameworks to achieve liberation resonates beyond its original context—though this very extension might itself be a kind of appropriation that needs marking.</div>

<div data-ref="4">Spinoza's concept of <em>conatus</em> is developed primarily in <em>Ethics</em>, Part III, Proposition 6: "Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being" (<em>Unaquaeque res, quantum in se est, in suo esse perseverare conatur</em>). See Benedict de Spinoza, <em>Ethics</em>, trans. Edwin Curley in <em>The Collected Works of Spinoza</em>, Vol. 1 (Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 498. The political implications are developed further in the <em>Political Treatise</em> and <em>Theologico-Political Treatise</em>.</div>

<div data-ref="5">Spinoza, <em>Ethics</em>, Part III, Proposition 7: "The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing but the actual essence of the thing." The Latin <em>conatus</em> carries meanings that "striving" doesn't fully capture—it suggests not just effort but a kind of structural tendency, the way a stone "strives" to fall or fire "strives" to rise in Aristotelian physics.</div>

<div data-ref="6">The temporal confusion of the conflict is analyzed brilliantly in Rashid Khalidi, <em>The Hundred Years' War on Palestine</em> (Metropolitan Books, 2020), where he shows how different chronologies—biblical, colonial, national—operate simultaneously and incompatibly.</div>

<div data-ref="7">Spinoza, <em>Ethics</em>, Part III, Proposition 7, op. cit.</div>

<div data-ref="8">See Michael A. Rosenthal, "Spinoza and the Philosophy of History," in <em>Spinoza's Political Philosophy</em> (Oxford University Press, 2019), especially his discussion of how rational organization of the <em>conatus</em> leads to democracy while passionate organization leads to theocracy or tyranny.</div>

<div data-ref="9">The relationship between Jewish trauma and Israeli sovereignty is complexly explored in Judith Butler, <em>Parting Ways: Jewishness and the Critique of Zionism</em> (Columbia University Press, 2012), especially Chapter 1, "Impossible, Necessary Task."</div>

<div data-ref="10">On the Nakba as ongoing rather than historical event, see Ahmad H. Sa'di and Lila Abu-Lughod, eds., <em>Nakba: Palestine, 1948, and the Claims of Memory</em> (Columbia University Press, 2007).</div>

<div data-ref="11">This formulation draws on but transforms Adorno's insight about the relationship between particular and universal in <em>Negative Dialectics</em>, trans. E.B. Ashton (Continuum, 1973), p. 314: "The smallest trace of senseless suffering in the empirical world belies all the identitarian philosophy that would talk us out of that suffering."</div>

<div data-ref="12">For detailed documentation of these policies, see B'Tselem, "A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid" (January 12, 2021). The report's title itself performs the movement from particular policies to systematic analysis.</div>

<div data-ref="13">The demographic logic of sovereignty is analyzed in Arnon Degani, "The Decline and Fall of the Israeli Military Government, 1948–1966: A Case of Settler-Colonial Consolidation?" <em>Settler Colonial Studies</em> 5, no. 1 (2015): 84-99.</div>

<div data-ref="14">Giorgio Agamben's concept of "bare life" illuminates this structure, though its application to Palestine requires careful modification. See <em>Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life</em>, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen (Stanford University Press, 1998). For a specifically Palestinian engagement with Agamben, see Ronit Lentin, "Palestine/Israel and State Criminality: Exception, Settler Colonialism and Racialization," <em>State Crime Journal</em> 5, no. 1 (2016): 32-50.</div>

<div data-ref="15">The phenomenology of justice as first appearing through the experience of injustice is explored in Eric Weil, <em>Logique de la philosophie</em> (Vrin, 1950), though Levinas will radicalize this insight.</div>

<div data-ref="16">Immanuel Kant, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, trans. Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1998), especially the Third Antinomy (A444/B472-A451/B479) where the split between phenomenal and noumenal is established.</div>

<div data-ref="17">Kant, <em>The Metaphysics of Morals</em>, trans. Mary Gregor (Cambridge University Press, 1996), 6:230-231. The "Universal Principle of Right" reads: "Any action is right if it can coexist with everyone's freedom in accordance with a universal law."</div>

<div data-ref="18">The violence of rights discourse's abstraction is powerfully analyzed in Wendy Brown, "Suffering Rights as Paradoxes," <em>Constellations</em> 7, no. 2 (2000): 230-241.</div>

<div data-ref="19" data-extension="true">The application of Hegelian logic to Israel-Palestine reveals its obscenity most clearly in certain liberal Zionist arguments that frame the conflict as a necessary stage in historical development. The Palestinian becomes a "moment" to be overcome in the march toward rational statehood. This reading appears explicitly in some interpretations of Israel as representing "progress" against "traditional" Palestinian society. See Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin, "Exile, History and the Nationalization of Jewish Memory," in <em>Exile and Return: Predicaments of Palestinians and Jews</em>, eds. Ann M. Lesch and Ian S. Lustick (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005), pp. 165-186, for a critique of how Hegelian progress narratives function in Zionist historiography.</div>

<div data-ref="20">Ibid., see the structure of the work itself: Part I: Abstract Right, Part II: Morality, Part III: Ethical Life.</div>
