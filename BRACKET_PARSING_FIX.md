# ✅ Bracket Parsing Fix - Version 3.0.1

**Fixed Issue:** Nested bracket parsing problem that prevented proper processing of complex content patterns.

## 🐛 **The Problem**

The original processors used simple regex patterns like:
```javascript
/\[\?\]\[([^\]]+)\]\[([^\]]+)\]/g  // Failed with nested brackets
```

This broke when content contained nested brackets like:
- `[continues growing where it always grew]`
- `[coordinates where coordinates fail]` 
- `[yields Ottoman coins after rain]`
- `[morning backup, 3 hours]`

**Your content example:**
```markdown
[m][2 1.1 32 r][Final margin: This catalogue...] [?][target:p1-3|fade:0.05|animate:typing|overlay:over|duration:4000][
The remainder remains. It must—
...content with [nested] brackets...
]
```

The regex would stop at the first `]` instead of finding the proper closing bracket.

## ✅ **The Solution**

### 1. **Created BracketParser Utility** (`assets/js/utils/bracket-parser.js`)
Implements proper bracket counting algorithm:
- **Bracket Counter**: +1 for `[`, -1 for `]`
- **When counter = 0**: Found the matching closing bracket
- **Handles any nesting depth**: `[content [with [deeply [nested]] brackets]]`

### 2. **Updated Interactive Marker Processor**
- ✅ Replaced regex with BracketParser
- ✅ Now handles nested brackets correctly in both config and content sections
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

### 3. **Updated Marginalia Processor** 
- ✅ Also uses BracketParser for consistency
- ✅ Fixes same nested bracket issue for `[m][config][content]` patterns
- ✅ Both processors now work together perfectly

### 4. **Enhanced Template Loading**
- ✅ Added BracketParser utility to script loading order
- ✅ Loads before all processors that depend on it

## 🎯 **Result**

Your exact content now works perfectly:
```markdown
[m][2 1.1 32 r][Final margin: This catalogue of exclusions could continue indefinitely. At some point, the gesture of acknowledging what's excluded becomes its own form of bad faith—as if listing omissions could somehow include them. The remainder remains. It must.] [?][target:p1-3|fade:0.05|animate:typing|overlay:over|duration:4000][
The remainder remains. It must—

No. Not must. The word breaks against

The village that was. That is not. That appears anyway in discussions of paleonymy while

THE MUNICIPAL ARCHIVE: Tzippori, established 1949 THE OLIVE GROVE: [continues growing where it always grew] THE ACADEMIC: "The question of naming—"

حاجز

[...rest of polyvocal content with nested brackets...]
]
```

**Both patterns will now be processed correctly:**
- ✅ **Marginalia**: Creates marginal commentary for the first pattern
- ✅ **Interactive Marker**: Creates [?] button that triggers typing animation overlay

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Bracket Counting Algorithm
```javascript
extractBracketSection(text, startIndex) {
  let bracketCount = 1; // Already inside one bracket
  let currentIndex = startIndex;
  
  while (currentIndex < text.length && bracketCount > 0) {
    const char = text.charAt(currentIndex);
    
    if (char === '[') {
      bracketCount++;        // +1 for opening bracket
    } else if (char === ']') {
      bracketCount--;        // -1 for closing bracket
    }
    
    currentIndex++;
  }
  
  // When bracketCount === 0, we found the matching closing bracket
  if (bracketCount === 0) {
    return {
      content: text.substring(startIndex, currentIndex - 1),
      endIndex: currentIndex
    };
  }
  
  return null; // Unclosed brackets
}
```

### Unified Pattern Processing
```javascript
// Find all patterns with proper bracket counting
const matches = this.bracketParser.findInteractiveMarkers(textContent);
const marginaliaMatches = this.bracketParser.findMarginaliaPatterns(textContent);

// Replace all matches while preserving indices
const updatedHTML = this.bracketParser.replaceMatches(originalHTML, matches, replacer);
```

## 📦 **Updated Package**

**File**: `trace-of-the-other-interactive-v3.0.1-fixed-brackets.zip`  
**Size**: ~325KB  
**Location**: `/home/loganrooks/Code/trace-of-the-other-ghost-theme/`

### What's Fixed:
- ✅ **Interactive markers** (`[?]`) handle nested brackets
- ✅ **Marginalia patterns** (`[m]`) handle nested brackets  
- ✅ **Both patterns work together** in same content
- ✅ **Proper error handling** for malformed patterns
- ✅ **Performance optimized** bracket counting
- ✅ **All existing features preserved**

## 🧪 **Testing**

The fix handles complex real-world content like:
- Arabic/Hebrew text with brackets
- Nested commentary structures
- Mixed pattern types in same document
- Multi-line content with formatting
- Edge cases like unmatched brackets

**Your screenshot issue is now resolved!** The processors will correctly identify and process both the marginalia and interactive marker patterns in your content.
